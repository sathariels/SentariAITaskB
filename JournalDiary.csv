iOS App Store,13097754751,5,LOVE,"A dedicated space for journaling just hits different, somehow. I have journals I can write in, and I use them from time to time. But I am more consistent with this.

iOS App Store,13023665506,2,Disappointed,"The Journey app, in general, seems like a great app for teens.  The design and number of creative options is definitely something that I think will make teens more apt to use it.

I was really excited about this app.  The reviews online stated there are 2 account options; a paid version, including all of the bells & whistles, and a ‘free’ version, which obviously includes some of the “fun” features but not all (which makes sense & I have no issue with).

I downloaded the app to see if my nieces would like it. INSERT DISAPPOINTMENT HERE!

The only “free version” I was able to find/see was the “free 3-day trial”.  THREE DAYS!!!! I admit, it’s better than nothing; it’s not a fair amount of time to really try the app out.",Jessa614,2025-08-16T08:21:25-07:00,0,0,5.5.9,,1755357685

You must download your entries (one at a time mind you) to your computer THEN upload them back to their server.  Shouldn't it be easy to do it in the app?  Yes.  Do they offer this?

I really loved this app. I purchased a one-year membership after enjoying it for about six months. I did not renew as money was tight. Everything I had written since the beginning disappeared.

I contacted support through the app and started a conversation a few times with people but no one ever followed through or maybe they just realized they couldn’t retrieve my lost entries and didn’t bother to get back to me. It’s a good app. I still recommend it, but make sure you back up your entries on the Icloud or something. Be careful. I just don’t think I can start all over again.

I downloaded lots of journals to see which one I would like. Somewhere a bit complex with lots of extra features but not so customizable. Like can't use your microphone gone or can't yolks pics. What I really wanted was a good basic journal that allowed me some fun features and the ability to upload pictures or what have you. This fits the bill.

This is unnecessary and it makes quickly going back to add/edit notes on different dates very tedious. You could simply have the Notepad editor on the same tab as the calendar. There are other apps that just quickly slide the notepad page up to the bottom of the SAME screen that the calendars are on. When clicking on a date (in the calendar tab) keep Calendar, date, etc.. up top on the screen. Notes AND notepad editor on the bottom. Change this app from opening a new tab when trying to edit/add/remove a note.
Also, For th calendar tab, if you were to put a small preview of a already written notes within the box of the specific date. That would be amazing.",Thecyguy,2023-08-20T20:20:53-07:00,0,0,5.1.2,,1692588053

I kept using it just because it has six years of my life documented, but I'm officially leaving this app. I've been traveling abroad this year, just writing entries on my phone as I frequently don't have access to wifi, and the other day I synced to the cloud for the first time in a while because the desktop app wasn't showing my entries I'd written on my phone. instead of updating my laptop with all my entries from my phone, it deleted all my new entries from my phone. So my laptop and phone are synced again, but the last five months of my journal entries are gone. Support has been somewhat responsive, but none of the suggestions they've given me have worked...the latest is ""the tech team is working on it""... I'll change this review if anything comes of that.

For example I have a tag call health. So I write, log, anytime I am sick or have blood drawn etc. and make sure I use the health tag.

Or if I change the oil in my car, I tag the entry with the name of my car. Any repairs to my house I write in journey and tag the entry with home.

Later when I want to see the history of car repairs or my health history, I can search for the specific tag. This helps in making further decisions like am I due for a physical  or how much work have I done on my home over the years etc.

All at the same time I can track phone conversations I have had with my adult children or track pics of my grandchild over time.

iOS App Store,8473241383,3,Mac App is unsable... (update),"Version 4 of Journey for the Mac on Monterey is virtually unusable.  The editor section is difficult in that the cursor disappears and jumps to new locations on its own (not due to typical track pad issues).  The copy and paste is, actually, terrible.  Pasting text duplicates it in the new location for some reason.  Also, after selecting text by highlighting it, it will suddenly remove the selection and you have to do it again or, even weirder, will change - all by itself - what text is selected from what you initially choose.

It's sad because this is a wonderful app on the other devices, but when I'm typing a lot and if I were to do this every day, a full size keyboard on my Mac is perfect (rather than the tiny keyboard on an iPhone screen or the iPad screen).

I would like to continue using this, but since my primary use in on the Mac and it is really messed up there, I may find something else and just consider my purchase a loss.

Update: The developer responded to me by email and noted this, ""Hi, the bug is caused by Mac Catalyst technology.""  I appreciate that the developer reached out to me.  I hope they are able to work with Apple on this and resolve the issues.",gregsabens,2022-03-19T10:11:23-07:00,1,1,4.1.17,,1647709883

iOS App Store,8148893267,1,Look Out For Auto-Renewals Without Advance Notice,"While the app is ok, be aware that this developer will not refund an auto-charge if you desire to cancel their so-called “cloud membership.” On top of a double-charge that was never refunded a year ago, these people do not send renewal reminders for their “cloud membership,” so if you don’t want the “cloud membership” after the first year, and you forget, or don’t know about your subscription, they will charge you whether you want it or not. The only recourse is to initiate a dispute with your credit card company. This developer will fight that too, so forewarned is forearmed. Individual customer service is a rude joke.

The overflow of text overlaps badly with the toolbar. If the text editor worked like it does in the web-app it would be perfect.

When I try to make an entry on my phone the app continually shuts down. No matter when I'm doing it closes after 2 min. 

My problems never were solved. In addition they refused to give a refund and said it was a problem with my network. I can't understand how the app constantly closing, and the app not syncing after the upgrade could be my network's problem. Yet the reason for rejecting my request was claiming I didn't try the free version first. Yet I have entries going back over two years.

But the worst part was that the app started nagging me for membership *even though I was already a member*. When I reported this issue to their support team, they couldn’t even locate my account without my first providing a receipt from my email. 

Long story short, the app is nice enough but these people are not professionals. I certainly wouldn’t buy their lifetime membership because they have issues managing annual memberships.

2. A indentation bug for bullet items. Every time you create a bullet item list and delete one item from the list, it pushes entire list to further right. This is easily reproducible. Support ticket was filed. Nothing happened either.  

Based on my most recent experience with the app, I changed my review from 5-star to 1 as I may have to look for an alternative now.  

— previous 5-star review 
This is a simple app for my daily journal. It has pretty much all I need except one thing. It has no ability to keep separate journal entries for work from personal life. The only way around that is by using tags, which is not ideal. So I only use this app for personal journal.

I’m not old-fashioned in many ways, but when it comes to the art or the craft of some thing, I take great pride in what I do. 

But when I wanted to transition my journaling from killing trees to taking up digital space, I found it difficult to find an app that would still allow me to express myself with color, images, and all of the intricate idiosyncrasies and flair that I add to my physical journals… But Journeys was the one. Now I can’t even imagine going back to paper. 

This app is beyond convenient. I upgraded to the premium version ( a one time payment which was extremely reasonably priced ) and now my phone’s app and the desktop app automatically sync up and all of my entries are stored in the cloud. The tags feature is incredible and lets me locate past entries with ease. There is a super fun “throwback “notification feature built in that this app will send you every so often to encourage you to read your past entries. For example, “you have a throwback entry from one year ago today.”

I am being serious when I say that I have never reviewed an app before, it’s not something I’ve ever felt compelled to do because I’ve not cared about an app enough to do so, but I really do love this app and would not want to live my life without it now that I know it.",v noiyce,2020-11-03T12:21:28-07:00,0,0,2.18.4,,1604431288

1. Needs the ability to mix videos, audio and photos
2. Multiple journals or folders

Good in other ways but:
1. Syncing is NOT FLAWLESS
2. Editing is ACCEPTABLE 
3. Coaches are a novel idea BUT MEH!
4. Presentation of multiple photos is smart STILL
5. Onetime payment and no subscription option. THERE IS A SUBSCRIPTION. I was nagged to subscribe, at first, when I tried to edit. I inadvertently (don’t ask) did and now I have access to the web version that I don’t use. 

I’m gonna take this as far as it will go. WENT BACK TO DAYONE (more polished) ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

iOS App Store,6101573145,4,Very versatile and cross platform. UI optimization needed.,"This is by far the most versatile journal I’ve used. It’s superb in the number of features. Rich text and metadata (tags, geo, etc) support is  outstanding. It’s cross platform and the Mac desktop app is not too bad either, even if you have to pay for it separately. 

It’s also very nice that you can unlock all of the useful features of the app through a one time purchase instead of going for a one of those never ending cost subscriptions. 

I do have one fairly major gripe. User interface is gorgeous but very inefficient. It takes so many taps/clicks to get anything done. Example: If I decide to add some tags to posts I made yesterday I have to first choose to edit it separately even if it is open, then navigate thru two screens to add the tags, close them and then go through an additional confirmation to save it. All of this can be so so much more efficient. That was just one example. 

A great app and the one time purchase to unlock all features is totally worth it.",ef.factor,2020-06-20T12:39:38-07:00,0,0,2.15.11,,1592681978

I specially like the way I can just talk into a microphone and it will record my journal because often I’m up and about walking or driving when I have thoughts and I want to be able to put them down without you no texting and endangering my life. I really like the way that you can tag your journals so if I have thoughts for an animation project or thoughts for walking I mean like I tend to have a meditation journal I just tag them that way and I can find them again later. There are one or two things you could do to tweak it like the microphone will stop recording if I don’t keep my finger on the screen moving because when my home screen comes up the microphone kicks out, or you could let me set my text color to always be paying instead of having to select every time I journal, but overall I am very impressed with this app and I actually paid for it which says a lot to me because normally apps aren’t worth paying for but this was I can highly recommend it.

So, I did research and found Journey. I have been using it for 8 months and it’s great. I especially love the coaching feature with short daily prompts.

I am moving away from anything that requires subscriptions. Thankfully journey had the foresight to see this getting out of hand. Unfortunately since operating systems are regularly updated and the only profitable app developers can afford to keep their products compatible it is likely we will see useful applications come and go. It is no longer about building an amazing application, it is also about building a standard that allows data and ideas to migrate. The fact that I was able to extract all of my data from one journaling application and import it into this and that I can export it from this and then to something else in the future if need be  says a great deal about the development of these kinds of standards.

A few suggestions:

1) Allow us to have multiple ""coaches"", instead of only one coach.  I do love this feature as it gives great prompts every day.  But we are only limited to one coach at a time.

2) Allow photos and voice recordings to be embedded within the text of a journal entry, instead of at the top of the post.

I have concluded that the Journey app is by far THE best journaling app. It was neck-to-neck with Day One (D1) but everyday I find something not worth paying D1 the monthly or annual subscription that Journey already has.  Journey’s ONE TIME Premium price is very affordable.  Journey focuses on its product, its usefulness.  Here’s the thing - if you’re going to write about your day or your feelings, you don’t need an app that charges you for the hype.  Day One’s approach of building much hype with fancy websites, acquiring writers and interviews of random people why they use D1 is all gibberish.  Prolly why D1 needs to charge a high subscription; someone has to pay to maintain their lavish marketing approach.

There is however one major complaint I have, and that is regarding the app security. I love that in set a password and use touch/face ID to unlock the journal. 

However, for the duration of time that I have used Journey, the security is frequently bypassed when I click on the Throwback notification, or simply when just opening the app. 

I have sent notes to the developer a number of times without response.

iOS App Store,5411475012,5,Journey is a great journaling app,"My daughter uses this app so when I decided I wanted to start journaling she showed it to me and explained all the things you can do. I really like being able to add photos, I can tag entries so they’re easier to find and lots of other things I can’t remember just now.  I’m going to play with it some more and discover all I can do. I was able to buy a lifetime subscription for only $9 and that’s not per month or year, it’s one and done. It is well worth it, while looking at other journaling apps I found most wanted $40 or so a year, Journey is a bargain and a delight.",lklamm,2020-01-16T09:01:01-07:00,0,0,2.15.1,,1579190461
iOS App Store,5408209523,5,Amazing!,"This is a wonderful app for journaling, with many great features (adding attachments, formatting, location, feeling, tags, etc.). I love being able to add pictures or a video to the post to add to the memories. It's fun to look back at candids I took on that day to bring back memories without needing to store the photos on my phone. I only wish you could add one video along with the 10 pictures in the same post rather than one or the other, or more pictures. There are features available to make each post unique, and prompts available for when you're feeling stuck or want to grow. My favorite part is looking at throwback posts. Plus, I love that I have Journey available on my phone or laptop, for journaling at home or whenever I need a brain dump.

iOS App Store,5385186631,5,I love it—after months of using it.,"I had another diary/journal for several months, but it would not sync with my phone. Since using Journey, I have found it perfect for my thoughts and daily devotions.

And it is free—however they constantly offer you the purchased version, which is bothersome. But I am very satisfied. You will be also.

I still use it for my journaling every day. And I still find it an outstanding journaling tool.

However, they never give up trying to get me to purchase the upgraded version.

I continue to use Journey as my daily journal, and love it. However, I still get frustrated with the ads to purchase their premium service, etc and I don’t need it. I just want a forum to make my comments daily.

The features are simple, almost kinda spartan which works for me right now as anything more complicated (I looked at a couple other apps and.....yikes)would just frustrate me.

When you’re juggling and you’re trying to do self-improvement you don’t want it to be more costly because you find yourself falling into debt and making yourself stressed out. Though this app gives some wonderful and wonderful advice it is definitely lacking in the drawing a person to consistency.

iOS App Store,5193877936,4,Good app - a couple of features needed,"This is a great journaling app. I switched from another One because of the lack of multi platform support and fee structure. I’ve recommended it to several people. 

Two key features would bump my rating. 

First, the ability to select multiple photos at a time for an entry. Currently I have to select each individually and go through the dialogue for each photo for the same event. This is my main complaint.

Second, app integration such as IFTTT support to auto add posts from Instagram, Twitter etc. This would put it over the top.

Other missing features - multiple journals (work, home) to compartmentalize entries; calendar, location and photo library  tie ins; templates.",Mjscores,2019-11-24T19:21:14-07:00,0,0,2.14.2,,1574648474
iOS App Store,5191691981,4,Best In Class,"The biggest thing this app has over all the other journals I have tried is its ability to easily export everything (including multimedia) to pdf or doc format.  There are several journal apps out there that have a few better features - but your data is basically stuck in these apps or can only export in text/pdf without the multimedia.  Journey appears to be the best wrt being future-proof, plus being able to export nicely to MS Word makes it a breeze to print your diary as a book if desired.

Otherwise - easily syncs with my mac mini, iphone and ipad.  Can add several media to each entry.  Subscription not needed.  Can creat an entry from email.  Can view entries by calendar, map or of course by day.  

Couple of features I would like to see.  One can only tag a daily entry - not specific phrases within entries.  Would be nice to tag specific phrases as tasks then use the excellent search engine to pull up any tasks.  Though I currently Write “Task” and then search.  Does not support multiple journals though their help page says they are working on this.  Themes are basic - can only change color.  Although you can add I think up to 10 photos per entry, the entry will only show one photo and does not allow you to embed the photos within your text.  So each entry shows one picture with an icon to tap to see the other pictures followed by your text below.  Would be nice to arrange photos and add text near each photo.",Vike99,2019-11-24T07:06:19-07:00,4,7,2.14.2,,1574604379

Easy to use and easy to write entries. This app is exactly as advertised and is great for what I need it for. However, I have a few recommendations that would make this app perfect:
1) if I could have two separate files to store my journal entries for sorting. Such as a file that I can title “dreams” to store dream journal entries and a file such as “daily entries” for my daily journaling.
2) if I could lock specific entries instead of the entire app. I don’t necessarily need to have my app locked, however due to a couple more personal entries I would love it if I could lock individual journal entries.

They stated that you could try it before purchase, yet I never saw that you could try out premium features. Overall, only purchase if you aren’t going to be dissatisfied with the features and make sure to try them out, beforehand, if even possible.

I am rating 4 stars for the fact of as much as I like about the app, there are some features I would desperately like to see added in future updates. Another reviewer mentioned wanting the option to have separate notebooks, and they liked the pay once plan for the premium features, which is an amazing thing compared to other journal apps that charge per month. I agree with this reviewer in these features. 

Another feature I would like to see is an option to use a ruled style paper with Apple Pencil support on the iPad. Sometimes I would rather have my journal be written in handwriting. It feels more personal to me writing with my own handwriting and reflecting on how my hand might have been shaky, or if I was writing quickly or paying attention to my words.

I would prefer a method of creating notebooks or separate journals instead of using tags, maybe it’s available but I haven’t found it yet.  I purchased the upgrade to be able to sync my entries because I use my phone and iPad to make journal entries.  I also went with this app for one major reason...no monthly fees...I hate the subscription plans, and regardless of how highly  they are rated I refuse to be held hostage to a company on a monthly basis.  So thank you Journey.  I’m giving it 4 stars because I cannot pick a default location.  The app uses a location close to my location, but not my actual location.  I can manually pick my correct location but it requires setting each time I make an entry.  I would like to pick a default location (this case my home address, not cell tower) for the journal entry.  If I spend the time to pick a location, I should have the option to make this my default location.

Tags vs notebooks
I prefer notebooks to tags as a way of separating journal entries.
Example:  I write a personal journal, work journal and project journals.  I would prefer each in its own notebook rather than included in one journal that requires me to separate and export information based on tags.",3galbyob,2019-01-24T10:20:16-07:00,2,2,2.9.17,,1548350416
iOS App Store,3677789864,3,Enjoyable App - Security Flaws,"I decided to pick up journaling in the new year - I have had a lot of things rolling around in my head and I have found it very helpful to write (type) them down.

My iPad is used by several different people on occasion, so I wanted a secure journaling app that only I could unlock (i.e. passcode unique to the app, secure storage of data, instant locking, etc.).

Journey seemed like the right fit, and initially performed so well that I bought the one-time premium add-on. Unfortunately about 25-50% of the time, when I open the app, it is unlocked and my journal entries can be read by anyone. This is a dealbreaker for me, as I need to trust that my entries are inaccessible in order to be comfortable to really write.

Note that this is with a passcode set and a 0s timeout on a 2018 iPad Pro 12.9”. Only occurs on initial launching of the app, then the locking starts working again.

Fix this and I’d give 5 stars!",Thehungrycoconut,2019-01-21T06:24:04-07:00,0,0,2.9.17,,1548077044

I would recommend this Journal if you’re looking for something secure and that backs up all your entries, so if you get a new phone, or uninstall for any reason, you just reinstall sign in and all of your entries will still be there...I just upgraded to the paid version it’s very much worth the 1 time payment...having to pay every year just doesn’t make sense to me, what If You can’t pay you lose all your entries?!! that you took so much time to write down, Nope I’ll stay with this Journal!! 
Thank you for this Awesome Journal

update: (Jan 18,2019) not sure why but it’s starting to clitch lately I’ll open it to journal and the writing will be super large, so I have to restart my phone a couple of times to get it working properly again. just closing and reopening the app doesn’t help.. and I’m constantly getting a pop up asking me to do premium.I am already a premium subscriber.. not sure what’s going on but i’m not too happy about it.",TheresaMm2,2019-01-18T10:02:32-07:00,0,0,2.9.17,,1547830952

I record time clearing out emails, important phone calls, etc. I’m trying to identify patterns or any clues I can find to help me manage my chaotic lifestyle.

I love the simplicity of journey, the clean uncluttered history, etc. You may have other, more personal and deeper purposes for this app. But for my own personal experiment I love how easily and quickly I can document my life!

It was fairly easy to import my data and the interface felt natural and familiar from the get-go. The only oddity is having to hit the plus sign in the top right to add an entry. I like Evernote’s take on this with the “+” button front and center.

Something I really like about Journey is that they have all the same features as DayOne (sometimes better) and they allow you to sync with whatever mechanism makes sense.

A big plus for me is also the ability to have multiple images per entry. I have kids, so it’s nice to be able to capture a few “angles” of the moment.

Another nice feature is the inclusion of a mood widget that allows you to quickly capture how you’re feeling.

I finished the edit and when I went back, it let me scroll down, but I had to hold it down. As soon as I let go it bounced back up. I exited and re-entered and it was cut off and locked again.

(Updated: If you share your device access and want your journal private, Journey still has a problem that’s now persisted for some time. It frequently requires me to reselect my Google Drive account on launch; and when it does this it often skips the unlock authorization.

I don’t have that much as it is.  Why can’t you just sell me the app?  I could do my own upload to the cloud if I wanted to.  I really don’t like the idea of all that personal information out there where anyone can get it.  If I wanted to do that I’d just start a blog!

Why can’t you just sell me the app (I’d probably be willing to pay as much as 10 dollars for it if it’s as good as it looks—but I’m not willing to give you access to my bank account, even if is only annually.  I have enough trouble with my finances as it is.

It’s time to start thinking of all your customers and not just the ones who are rolling in dough—we need it just as much as they do.

Can’t you offer a version where we can get most of the bells and whistles (like the fonts and such) without a subscription?

Two stars, although it would probably be more if I didn’t have to subscribe.  I’ve been using this all day and really like what I see so far, but I DONT WANT A SUBSCRIPTION!",Craftmomma,2018-07-11T16:47:25-07:00,2,3,2.7.0,,1531352845

With programs for nearly every platform and the ability to attach photos and videos, Journey is the ideal app that allows you to include all the information you want. Not only does it come with plenty of features, it’s free to. With their web based journaling you can write entries from any device with internet access. The layout and design of the app is appealing to look at and it doesn’t feature ads which is a great thing since I find they can distract me from what I’m writing.
