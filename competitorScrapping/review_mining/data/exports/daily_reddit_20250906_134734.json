      "content": "Hey everyone  Ive always struggled with journaling. I love the idea, but staring at a blank page felt overwhelming and I usually quit after a few days. So I tried something different: just one line a day. One question, one quick answer. Thats it.  Examples of questions I answer:  What made you smile today?  What gave you energy today?  Whats one little thing youre proud of? It takes less than a minute, but weirdly it makes me more mindful and grateful. Since it worked for me, I built a super simple app called OneLine that does exactly this:  Gives you one prompt a day (same for all users)  Keeps all your answers private, only on your device  Sends a friendly reminder at the time you choose Its free, no ads, no accounts  just a tiny tool to build a daily reflection habit. If anyones interested, heres the link:  (Id love any feedback too ) Even if you dont try the app, I genuinely recommend giving one line a day a shot. Its surprisingly powerful.",

I only reflect on progress at the end of the month because too many progress checks can become defeating. #5-Everything and anything that pops up in my mind. #6- I had too many physical journals to juggle and found the templates to restrictive. Now I have an iPad and the Goodnotes app instead, and its exactly what I needed.  #7 - Hand draw my own templates really fixed my writing problems.",

AND it lets me see from the very beginning how ive changed in emotions, mental states, and skill. its helped a lot and i find it a lot of fun! it can literally be about ANYTHING, you just have to write! i started reading this post and went i should start a journal theyre right... wait a minute.

      "content": "July already? It's been 140 days since I left my job, and I'm still unemployed. It's been 188 days since my girlfriend dumped me and moved to the UK. My best friend's wedding is in a month, and I'm not even sure if I can attend from Abu Dhabi. I swore I'd be in shape by then, but my wallet's empty, and the only things growing are my gut, insomnia, jealousy, self-hate, depression, and anxiety. My career and personal life are circling the drain. Since coming to Abu Dhabi, I've become incredibly lazy. All I do is smoke, stay home, and play video games. I've stopped applying for jobs; it feels like everything's a ghost posting, and I'm convinced I won't get hired here without a degree and experience. I might end up in some random job, slaving away in this scorching heat, becoming a bald machine like my father. I genuinely don't understand why people live here. There's no life, just struggle. I was better off in Bangalore. Any effort I'm putting into finding a job here, if I'd done it there, I'd have a job by now. By September, it'll be a year since she left for the UK. She'll have her master's in another year, and that's what truly kills me. I know comparison is the thief of joy, but it's constantly on my mind. I've lost all interest in staying in Abu Dhabi; I can't see any good coming from it. I miss the rain, man, and there's none here. I wish I'd thought this through before coming, but at the time, I needed to escape the breakup. Now my dad won't let me leave. My dad initially came to Abu Dhabi to pay off a 25 lakh loan. Now he's 50 lakhs in debt with no savings, still drowning. I don't know what to do, and I really don't want to work my life away to cover his mistakes. I'd rather take out a 50 lakh loan to study in the UK than clean up his mess. Vivi's (my bf) last words to me before I left Bangalore were to never put myself in a place where I hate myself, and I already hate everything. Is it me? Will I never be happy wherever I go, or am I the only one struggling like this? My parents are idiots, and I'm no different. There's no one to help me. Not even luck.",

      "content": "It feels good to be lazy if you don't get anxious a tad bit. In my case, I feel like I can afford a day or two of laziness but more than that and I'm already feeling anxious. Today was a lazy day, and it felt good not doing anything apart from what I promised myself I'd do. Keeping it to a minimum. # Diary Post #41 - Sweet laziness Hey I'm back, never left actually. I've done everything I needed to do today, worked out, ate my meals, took my shower, took care of my teeth and cleaned my face properly. What else did I do? Nothing really. I've been working slowly on the new tracker idea I had yesterday, cleaned a few things in the room and that's about it. The whole day spent playing games or relax outside because fuck it. I've even played 7 LoL games today and I might do one more before bed. I would lie if I said I was totally comfortable doing so though, it felt somewhat bad because M was being productive on her side and I wasn't. I also feel like ever since I've set up my desktop here I have used it as much as I can, but that's what I do best, computer stuff. So I don't quite know how to feel just yet apart from lazy. I've just started my workout yesterday and that makes me tired, maybe that's the reason. The reason could also very well be the fact that these past 2 weeks have been successful in my eyes, I am doing great on the things I promised myself I would do and that's enough for now. Once again if I do too much then I'm just gonna start feeling overwhelmed, give up on everything and go back to old habits. I don't want that... Well I shouldn't focus too much on how I felt today, off days happen and this is one of those. I should focus on the \"tomorrows\" and see how my mood shifts. In the meantime as a quick note since I forgot to mention this yesterday, my tracker already has its structure. Meaning that I don't need to track my habits here anymore, yesterday's entry didn't contain it so there's the explanation for it. (That's it for now.)  What I did today:  Worked more on the workout  lifestyle plan  Played 7 LoL games  Relaxed in the sun  How I felt today:  Lazy What I'm grateful for today:  Free time - Oldie but being able to choose what I want to do is great. If I had a job now I wouldn't have as many opportunities to decide when to feel lazy. I'm extremely grateful for all that freedom, it's something that's never been free and I'm lucky to be in my situation.  Sunny day in early February - It was a nice weather really. Apparently it's gonna be like this for the whole week. Happy to hear it!",

Now when I analyze what is going on during the day I find a lot of things that I wish I wouldn't do or probably do in regulation. I am no saint if you see my routine, to be fair my routing is fucked. Sleep timings are odd for no reason, I do give in to my cravings of Nicotine and alcohol, indulging in PMO more nowadays, Binge watching series, spending a lot of time on reddit, not working towards my goal. etc Obviously I imagine that I can turn this exactly around one day. Although I know it can happen but that one day seems far off. Lets have a newer approach this time. Break this habits one by one. From tomorrow I will try to break at least one of these habits. Even if I break a small or micro change I am going to be very happy and appreciative of myself. Typing thoughts instead of writing them has actually been very helpful for me. Putting my thoughts into words is not something I thought I would like. If I can make a change like this then I can do more changes. I am sure I will see the progress in myself.

      "content": "2025 September 6: Dear Diary, Last night I went out with my dad to a restaurant. It was a really nice place and I certainly would go back there again. The biggest reason I would go back was because of a compliment I received from a waitress. Who allowed you to have such amazing hair, she said. I couldnt even react right away. I was flustered as hell. The boldness of the compliment was not something I have really heard before. It took me maybe two minutes to reply. You have very nice glasses, I replied. I meant it, the glasses really suited her. She thanked me for saying something about the glasses because they were new and she was not sure about them. That really made me happy knowing that my compliment meant something. It is always great to compliment others, especially when they compliment you. It would be nice if I could be so bold in my compliments. Luckily I was able to say something without even having a drink. My hair means a lot to me, so it was nice to hear someone else think it looks good. Does this mean I require validation from others? I do not think so. I just think it is nice to hear something nice like that. It is awesome to see good people interacting in life. Sincerely, Torinico",

Daily affirmations and exercise can be part of a healing journey, but acting like theyre universal cures just ends up making people feel invalidated or blamed when they dont work.

Youre right , sometimes people dont need a solution thrown at them, they just need someone to listen and say, 'That sounds really hard, Im here for you.' Empathy goes a lot further than recycled advice. Thanks for putting this into words.",

      "content": "Hello! A few years back, during a large, large dip in my mental health, I used to keep a journal. The school gave it me and I never brung it home. I struggled alot, I couldn't go into lessons, and my attendance was very poor. The only part of the school I could access was the sensory room, where I kept my journal, and with nobody to talk to, it was the only thing I could vent into. Most of the time, I wrote into it, expressed the words I bottled up, and I felt refreshed almost. As time passed, as my speaking stopped, it was passed onto authorities to have a look at. You could guess what happened, they initially thought I was having nightmares. That's when I thought about giving up on myself before weeks later, the journal changed the eyes of many as I kept using it, and with progress, it helped me move schools. This is why a journal is so important. If you're so lonely, I recommend keeping one as it's like a buddy you can be yourself around. Wishing you luck with your mental health. I know it's hard, but it gets better.",

I purchased 4 journals over 2 years, beautiful journals with quality paper and covers that I loved. Didn't touch them. Until this year. I went through something horrific, and this year I found myself living alone in a place quite far from distractions. I started to journal and my god... Why did I delay. The hardest part was just starting. I was so concerned about what to write, how to write, how pretty the pages looked, how cohesive it would be. Stop. Just write. Write anything. My first entry was just an admission I found it hard to start. Before I knew it, I was 4 pages deep and words were just flowing out without thought. When I finished the entry I read it back and was astounded. I wrote that? It was visceral, honest, reflective. The plug was pulled out and I have not stopped journalling. Not every day, but a few days a week. Sometimes it's just letters to my past self, letters from my future self, goals or a single sentence. Sometimes it's a complete expulsion of trauma I've never said out loud. Sometimes it's very positive, sometimes it's self hating. Sometimes it's poetic and eloquent and I can't even believe I've written it.. I feel the changes. My body is more rested, my mind is quieter. It's done a lot for me, more than any therapy. But combined with therapy and somatic exercises it's changing my brain chemistry profoundly. I can rely on myself more now, to process things, feel safe and talk myself through triggers. Highly recommend!",

Then I read Counselling for Toads (蛤蟆先生去看心理医生) and came across the idea of a mood thermometer.That inspired me to create Mubble  洗心日记, a gentle mood diary app where you can:  give your day a mood score  write a short reflection  slowly notice patterns in your feelings Using it myself has helped me feel calmer, more self-aware, and even a little happier. Right now, the app is only in Chinese (English support is coming soon). Its available on the Apple App Store (not yet on Google Play). Im inviting 12 people to test it  and when the testing phase is done, Ill give them permanent membership as thanks. Im sharing this because journaling and mood tracking really helped me, and maybe it can help someone else too. If youd like to test, or just share how you track your moods, Id love to hear.",

I dont think he understood how pissed I was and the way I vented it but our friendship is still beyond fine. The walk back was sad and lonely, and it reminded me of a burden I carry of trying to do good by others but also not being attractive. This week has gone a lot better though. I got to see my mom for the first time since moving back to college. It was good to see her even though it made me a little homesick. Watched eagles cowboys today despite the rain delay. My buddies and I had a great time and that was probably the hardest Ive laughed in a while. They are my brothers, and I wouldnt trade them for the world Weekend is chocked full of events and Ill probably make a post covering the weekend and my feelings on it if anyone cares (dont blame u if u dont) but until next time...",

Lately, Ive been building a Telegram-based tool for myself: it helps me track my mood, do short self-care practices, write down my thoughts. I'm not a fan of journaling by hand, but my therapist gives me homework  so I started putting it into the bot to make it easier to follow. I'm curious:  Have you ever used apps like this?  Did they actually help you feel supported  even a little?  Or did you try and feel they werent for you?  Do you have a favorite feature or app that really made a difference?  Maybe youve seen any on this topic? Any thoughts would be appreciated. My goal is to make something that genuinely helps  especially in those moments when theres no one else around to talk to. Thank you  I hope your day brings you even a little bit of light.",

      "content": "Hey everyone, I wanted to share something that's been making a genuine difference for me lately. A few months ago, I was in a pretty rough place mentally. Just constantly overthinking, beating myself up, and letting negative thoughts loop in my head. After trying various things that didn't stick (traditional journaling, yoga), I've been using a voice journaling app called Archie that actually works for me, and I thought it might help others here too. The breakthrough for me was realizing I needed to get thoughts OUT of my head, but writing them down felt like too much effort when I was already struggling. Speaking in stream of consciousness though? I could do that. What's made the biggest difference is how the app gently points out when I'm using really harsh language about myself or catastrophizing situations. I didn't even notice how often I was saying things like \"I have to be fun\" or \"Why did I do that?\" until seeing it highlighted. The app suggests small shifts in language that help change how I see the world and myself and others. For example, last week I was spiraling about a work mistake and rambled into my phone about how \"I always mess everything up.\" The app suggested reframing it as a\"valuable learning opportunity.\" A subtle change for sure, but it helped me to rethink how I think about the things that feed my anxiety. I'm not saying it's some miracle cure, I still have rough days, but having a place to dump my negative thoughts and then see them from a different angle has made them feel less overwhelming. I feel like I can sorta breathe again.",

I started journaling every single day, not just dumping my thoughts, but actually using prompts to guide me, and its wild how much its helped me untangle my brain and feel more grounded. Some things that worked for me:  Using short, simple prompts like What do I need to let go of today? or Whats one small thing Im proud of?  Tracking habits that affect my mood (like sleep or screen time).  Ending each entry with one positive thing, even on bad days. I started making my own digital prompts and self-care trackers because nothing I found online felt exactly right for me. Surprisingly, friends started asking for them, so I put them up on Etsy (under Pastel Prompts) just in case they help anyone else too. But honestly, you dont need anything fancy to start, even a blank Google Doc or notebook works. If anyones curious, I can share my favorite beginner-friendly prompts that helped me stop overthinking when I first started!",

      "content": "Smoking weed to distract yourself from your problems is very similar to putting a band aid on a cut. It does not heal the problem you are having. That statement doesn't change the fact that these things have beneficial uses. The difference between the two is that one can prevent infection, and the other can amplify your enjoyment of your surroundings, and with almost no notable cause of harm to physical health, but you probably already knew those facts. What should be noted is that there is another similarity between band aids and marijuana. In some cases, you can be allergic to both. Now, I'm sure that someone can be physically allergic to marijuana, but the allergy I'm referring to with weed is mental in nature. Almost everyone I know who smokes weed has had an occasional bout of Anxiety, and that's pretty normal. But some people smoke weed and it causes Panic Attacks, and at it's worst, can trigger Psychosis. This isn't the medical definition, but long story short, Psychosis can cause Hallucinations and you can very easily believe these Hallucinations to be real. Without getting into detail, I can confirm on a personal experience that Marijuana has on multiple ocassions caused me to have bouts of Psychosis, and on one particularly bad instance, endangered not only my life, but the life of a loved one as well. Before this ever happened, I was diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety, and at no point did my Doctor ever prescribe or even recommend weed. In fact, she discouraged me from more than ever dabbling with it. Of course, being the average young adult that I am, I didn't listen, because the majority of friends smoke weed, because a lot of people I know smoke weed daily to cope with Anxiety and Depression. I did it because everyone is doing it. Not to sound like your parents, but if everybody jumped off a bridge, would you? If you smoke weed to cope with suppressed emotions like Depression or Anxiety, you need to let your Doctor know that. They need to know you are struggling, and they need to know if you ever had a Panic Attack or Anxiety on marijuana. Marijuana does not cure mental diseases, it merely provides the potential for distraction. When a doctor prescribes Marijuana, it is because it's a lot healthier on your physical body than probably any other drug they could prescribe you to deal with distraction. The Doctor has determined that with your Mental Illness, you will NEED distraction to help cope with it. Distraction is not inherently a bad thing, but it certainly is when you are distracting yourself from being safe. tl;dr: Smoking Weed can be a good thing for people with mental issues, but only when a Doctor recommends it's use.",

      "content": "Hey rmentalhealth! We're looking to grow our moderation team. Moderators are a key part of what makes any reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you. # What do the mods do? Moderators here on mentalhealth work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of mental health and the ways that mental health and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep. # What are the minimum requirements to apply? Can I apply if I've never been a moderator before? If you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about mental health and the rmentalhealth community, fit well with our team, and want to help. If this describes you there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you check out the reddit training offered here.( # What are the expectations for moderators who join the rmentalhealth mod team? Mod team members need to be a part of the team. We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our mod team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to. # Is there anything I should know about moderating rmentalhealth before I apply? Yes. rmentalhealth is a support community for mental health and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing. Our team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely. If you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met. No one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team. Second, we require that moderators join our discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a discord account (can be an existing account if you have one). # How do I apply? If you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow: 1. Send us a modmail indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:  What does mental health mean to you?  Why are you interested in being a moderator on rmentalhealth?  In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator? 2. We will review your modmail and your application. We may ask for some additional information about your moderation experience and how familiar you are with reddit. We may use a google form to structure those questions. 3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator. 4. New moderators on the rmentalhealth moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about four weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed. Thanks for reading, and we hope you apply!",

This piece, Elevate, is me putting those thoughts into words, about growth, challenges, and the decision to step into my own power before hitting the next decade. # Elevate Who wouldve thought Id be sitting on the edge of 30, same old baggage being carried up the same old staircase. I did. My third eye has shown me my future more times than I can remember, pointing out those same old flaws begging me to get rid. I was waiting patiently for the Lord to give me the answers, until I ran out of patience to give. No one told me I was supposed to go and find the answers, that arrogance has been expensive. You dont know the things I've almost lost from losing myself, or maybe you do. Maybe theres other people out there only caked in failure, and they know what I've been through. But that companionship is empty because wrong is still wrong, and Id rather be lonely than fit in somewhere I dont belong. Maybe your mistakes define you, but I wasnt sent here for mediocrity. My mistakes have been lessons, and I've been skipping class for too long. 29-30 is 365 days to become dangerous, find MY north star, and elevate. Stars are out of reach only for those who impose things on themselves that keep them grounded. But me? I elevate. Some will join me. Some might fall short. Many will try to tear me down, and yet still, I elevate. I rise. I break. I shift. I elevate. And when all is said and done, the ghost that once haunted me will give me the nod of approval because my third eye is still showing me my future. Its seen the shift, changed the trajectories, because truly, this is the season, that I elevate.",

      "content": "It should include the biopsychosocial spectrum, as this whole spectrum is potentially influencing mood. The user should be able to enter data as simply as possible, which will be automatically queried daily by the app, ideally classified. The main documentation should focus on the user's mood and affective state. Subsequently, potential influencing factors should be tracked, including dietary patterns (fast foodwhole foods, hydration), substances (coffee, nicotine, etc.), physical activities, sports, and sleep quality, as well as social engagement and social environment. The goal is to visualize possible correlations between influencing factors and the user's mental and physical condition, thus raising awareness of potential maladaptive lifestyle habits. Additionally, other factors should be tracked, such as the communication level to the subconscious through, for example, dream patterns and dream symbolism, as well as the impact of biopsychosocial events on mood. The whole should be visualized using graphics with time references. I know I'm asking for a lot but the mood trackers I've discovered so far are not really user friendly! I just want a simple and brief entry of data at the end of the day. Without writing too much text or anything. It would be perfect if I could build my own classified data sheet which the app then will automatically query, so I can get as much of a holistic and non reductive approach on identifying influences on mood. Do I have to build my own or does anyone know an app with such features? Thanks in advance!",

Its called Upbeing.ai( (UpBeing on app stores) You can add your own journal to the app, tracking everything from food intake, to water intake and more. I know the app also looks at weather patterns in your area, news sentiment and other factors to see how your immediate external environment is affecting you (I'm 57 happier when the weather is above 12 degrees Celsius). It also allows you to connect to apps like your Spotify, Health app, and wearables to see how your activity and music is affecting your daily and mental health. The best part about the app is it allows you to connect with your friends and family in your closest circle, and check in on how they're feeling, whilst letting them view your current moods.",

      "content": "For years, I tortured myself with failed habits. Meditation? 3 days and done. Journaling? A notebook with 10 sad pages collecting dust. Cold showers? Painful, but pointless. I thought I was lazy. Turns out, I was just fighting the way my brain works. Heres what finally clicked: 1. Your brain hates habits but loves patterns I used to wait for the perfect reading setup: comfy chair, quiet room, good lighting. That moment never came. So I shifted. Instead of mindlessly watch videos and posts on commutes, lunch breaks, or waiting rooms, I read. Result? 3 books in 3 months. Not record-breaking, but a personal win. 2. Systems  willpower Blank pages killed my journaling attempts. Not knowing where to start  instant shutdown, I felt completely lost. Then I realized: my brain resists decisions, not writing. I researched decision fatigue so I built this daily note structure:  Capture  What caught my attention today?  Connect  Why does it matter? Does it link to a projectgoal?  Next step  Is there an action, or just something worth keeping?  Top 3 Objectives  Task Backlog (auto-shows todays tasks by priority)  Completed Today (auto-log of done tasks)  Reflection  Whats going well? Whats blocking me?  Tomorrows Objectives Thats it. No essays. Just fill in the blanks. Ideas stop floating in sticky notes, apps, and land in one trusted place (for me, its digital, but a notebook works too). Over time, daily notes become a web of insights tied to what I actually care about. 3.Progress  perfection My gym system is stupidly simple: Show up. Stretch if Im not feeling it. Let momentum decide. 80 of the time, I lift. 20 I just walk. Either way  a win When you design around your actual behaviors (instead of copying routines off social media), progress stops feeling like punishment. Habits still matter, but when a system absorbs them and gives them a direction (you build it), they stop being a battle. They just... run in the background. Nonetheless, if you try to to do something that definetely doesn't resonate with you, your goals, values, etc. It doesn't matter if you build the most complex and seamless system, you will still not do it. So, this applies just when you care about achieving something (doesn't matter if it is really heart, you will figure out how to do it :) ) What has worked for you to make your goals happen?",

I started this habit tracker a couple of weeks back not to be perfect, but to test my mental toughness, time management, and overall consistency. But heres the thing: I fell off. Some days I crushed it. Other days especially weekends I completely lost momentum. Id pivot, chase random distractions, or just question if these habits were even useful. Its not like I couldnt do these things. Physically, I can. But mentally? I slipped. This wasnt about being ultraproductive or checking every box. It was about testing my limits. I wanted to learn:  What is my real potential?  Where does my discipline break down?  Am I just playing the game of busywork or really building myself? The hardest part is... I believe in quality over quantity. I value deep, focused work but when things get tough or boring, I drift. I let the randomness win. So heres my reset: 1.Im pulling out Cant Hurt Me by David Goggins its been sitting unread for too long. 2.Ill read it fully this time. No skipping. No half-measures. 3.Ill journal insights. And Ill restart my habit tracking not to do more but to build grit and master myself. This post is my line in the sand. If youve been here riding that rollercoaster of motivation and inconsistency lets talk.",

Id often mark things as done just to keep the streak going - even if I didnt actually do them. It felt good in the moment, but long-term it killed any sense of real progress. So I decided to build my own system: one where I could only mark a task done if I took a photo of it and it actually verifies if the photo matches the task that I have to do  Example: - Made the bed? Take a photo. - Did a workout? Photo. - Went for a walk? Snap it. Its weird, but its helped me stop cheating and made me more honest with myself. Just wondering if anyone else has built personal rules like this to stay consistent or keep yourself accountable? Would love to hear your strategies.",

A few options you might consider: Purposemeaning work: Beyond habits, ask yourself why you want to feel better. Volunteering, creating something, or giving to other individuals might give you a feeling of meaning that daily routines perhaps do not attain. Challenge of novelty: At times the brain needs new stimulation. Learning a new skill, language, or hobby might create interest. Mindfulness  acceptance exercises: Not how to \"get rid of\" the emptiness, but how to sit with it without letting it define you. ACT ( Acceptance  Commitment Therapy ) is great for. Medication review: Even though you're on antidepressants, sometimes the dosage, type, or combination isn't quite right. Worth checking in with your psychiatrist. Spiritualityexistential searching: Certain individuals have grounding in philosophy, religion, or just raising broader questions about life. You're not failing, you've created a foundation. What's next is maybe less \"more habits\" and more meaning, alignment, and depth.",

And yeah... didnt expect this. First thing that hit me was sleep. Real sleep. Like actually waking up rested. Then the brain fog started lifting. My thoughts got clearer. I stopped zoning out every 10 minutes. I actually finish things now lol. Confidence came back too. Once I saw I could quit something that felt impossible, I started believing I could do a lot more. Even got a job. First one in a while. If youve been stuck in that loop, just know it does get better. Way faster than I thought. Heres what I noticed: - real, deep sleep - better focus  memory - way less anxiety - more energy to actually do stuff - confidence boost - more time (and money) - got a job, got momentum, got my mind back Im not anti-weed, but daily use? That shit had me made stuck.",

This was suggested to me by a friend when I mentioned I was struggling with keeping track of tasks and ideas throughout the day. What I've found is that this small habit not only helps clear my mind, but somehow also sets the tone for a more organized and productive day. Initially, I was skeptical - could something so simple really be effective? Turns out, the act of writing down my jumbled thoughts and to-do lists seems to stop them from bouncing around aimlessly in my head. This process allows me to identify what truly requires my focus for the day and highlights any recurring concerns. Id love to hear how others manage their mental clutter or if anyone else uses a similar technique in their morning routine. Its been a game-changer for me in a surprisingly subtle way.",

Nothing works in the long run. But about 2 months ago, I started doing somthing that actually changed things for me. I began keeping a \"procrastination journal\" (sounds stupid, I know, but hear me out). Every time I caught myself procrastinating, I'd quickly jot down:  What I was supposed to be doing  What I was doing instead (usually scrolling Reddit or watching yt shorts)  How I was feeling in that moment And then I would read it at the end of the day. At first, it felt pointless. But after a few weeks, I started noticing patterns. Turns out, I wasn't just being \"lazy\" - I was avoiding specific types of tasks when I felt overwhelmed or unsure where to start. I am a software dev who also do the product management at my company. And I hate doing \"research\" on features. The weird thing is, just being aware of these patterns made them easier to deal with. When I know that if i had to do research, greater changes i won't be productive today. And now Instead of beating myself up, I started break down the scary tasks into smaller chunks. I'm not saying I'm some productivity guru now and I still waste time watching stupid yt videos when I should be working. But holy shit, the difference is night and day. Projects that used to take me forever to start are getting done without the usual last-minute panic.",

Through the week, I do a few evening meetings and classes, which I love. Today for example, I have a zoom yoga class at 7pm, and Ive spent the entire day almost mentally consumed by it and preparing for it. It doesnt make me anxious or anything, its just like this giant, heavy, unmovable block at the end of my day. Its like I have to keep it at the forefront of mind the whole time, in case I forget, or I miss it. Does anyone else feel something similar?",

Keeping a journal is probably the best decision I ever made and if it interests you, I say go for it. I don't think there's any \"wrong\" way to journal, it's just a matter of trying different things and finding what works best for you. What will you use it for? Planning projects? Jotting down your dreams? Detailing your day? Working through your feelings? Writing \"to do\" lists? What kind of container works best for you? A hard bound journal, an app on your phone or typing on a keyboard? The reasons one keeps a journal are as unique and diverse as the people who keep them, but it's been especially fun for me to have a running record of my life and to be able to look back on what was important to me when I was 13 or when I was 30. It also made me a much better writer!",

What keeps you consistent (or what made you quit)?  Would you use an app that syncs with a physical journal?

This is both a blessing and a curse because I don't have someone breathing down my neck everyday, but at the same time my boss really has no idea what I do. This lead me to taking daily notes on what i did through the course of the day. Currently I take notes on a regular diary app everyday and then weekly I export them, then import them to chatgpt to summarize my work for the week. Then export that and viola, my week summarized. I want to utilize voice to text and AI to automate as much of this as possible. For example, on my drive home from work, I speak to my phone descriving all of my activies each day, Then that entry is saved. Then once a week, somehow all these entries are summarized using AI and maybe sent to me via e-mail? Any thoughts or suggestions? Thanks!",

One habit thats really helped me recently is asking myself: What am I doing right now? and checking whether Im acting automatically or unconsciously. It sounds small, but this kind of self-feedback has saved me a surprising amount of time. Im curious  have others here tried similar approaches to improve productivity? Did it work for you?",

Board( Again, not daily here, but frequently. Type something, tap a button, what you typed is now full-screen on your phone. Use case: My significant other is on the phone and I need to tell her something important or remind her of something related to the call. Instead of interrupting, I type it in Board, then show her the phone. You can slide-show it too  have multiple parts of a message you swipe through.

My reddit usage definitely went overboard last night   Sorry for the S23 and Z Fold 5 users that had their phones crash. :( What is Habitually( A Frankenstein accounting tool for your life. Its majority journal  habit tracker app combined with a mood diary. Play Store Link( Features  Benefits Journaling Track whatever action or event in your day. Like simple yes or no answers to stats like reddit usage or tea intake. A key benefit is the simplicity I have developed after 2 years of my own usage, which until recently I am finally happy with. A good case study is a reddit post showing 200 actions that I recorded daily in a year: Post in question( (A lot of people wonder but the time using the app is less than 5 mins daily.) Mood diary Instead of having 20 words to define your happiness. I split happiness into 3 pillars:  Mental well-being  Physical well-being  Social well-being Being wider reaching, even if you feel happy emotionally, there is nuance in knowing if that coincided with beneficialnegative physical or social feelings. Others  CSV, JSON export at any time  Reminders on a weekly, monthly or custom timeframe  Lots of stats and charts  On device machine learning (not a chat-gpt wrapper), calculates from every journal and mood entry the impact of your actions on your life  lots more Play Store Link( Website( Pricing Freemium - Full access with ads Similar to the Spotify model, one rewarded ad covers one day of usage. I am not interested in creating artificial barriers of access, the ads simply cover any costs for usage so everyone gets worry free storage and syncing. Month 0.79 (9.48yr) Year 9.49 (0.79mo) Lifetime 14.99 or 11.99 if bought within 2 weeks of creating an account. For fun and a laugh, the same rewarded ad you can watch in the settings screen extends the month and year subscription by a day. Stats and how its going after a year From incompetence and a hatred of marketing: 500 downloads - Most from a single post I made in April. 40 DAU (fluctuates - 10) 6 retention for long term use is kinda cool. Update Plan  Playground screen - customisable charts or models to find relationships in your life.  Multiple reminders - some way for each action to have more than one reminder.  Less show and more tell - want to explain charts and stats instead of simply dumping them on a screen  Swap between NightLight theme. The app already follows the device theme but doing this in app would be useful. This is my first serious project with a worldwide audience with just as much variety in devices and OS. So making Habitually work for anyone anywhere is a huge priority. If you want, how you can help Being obsessed with Habitually I naturally have blind spots. Additionally, everyone is not me and have their own tastesideas so go nuts with the feedback or ideas. Where you can reach me:  Email:   Message me here on reddit or comment on this post if it will publicly benefit people PROMO CODES The lifetime codes given are permanent unless you delete the associated account. They are redeemed in-app - settings screen - promo code section (close to the bottom of the screen) I'll check for blatantly obvious bot accounts before sending them via dms. Edit 1: Progress: 80 of the way. Sorry for taking so long. Especially sorry for a Samsung S23 user who had a crash. Will work to be better :( Edit 2: Progress Last 10 to go. Sorry for anyone kept waiting, I'm about to call it for the night. Somehow Samsung are struggling as a Z Fold 5 has crashed too. Which I will look into as my brother has that phone. I use a S20 Ultra, own a S8 and S10, so these crashes are of my own fault and not a weird Android Behaviour. Luckily that also means there is a fix that won't be too hard. Edit 3: And all the codes are done. We can take this off reddit now. So any feedback or ideas emailed to me at:  will be rewarded with a Lifetime Subscription",

Initially it would just be for himself, but if he feels comfortable enough, he would maybe share them with his assistant andor me. I think that he uses an android smartphone.",

It's meant to help with getting your personal daily goals done as well as giving you random tasks to complete to make you feel better about your day and encourage social interactions Heres what it does: Daily challenges by category  pick from areas like mindfulness, creativity, kindness, or fitness. The app randomly generates tasks so you always have something fresh. Custom lists  make your own to-do lists, create your own personal challenges, routines, or even chore lists. You can switch between random prompts and your own tasks anytime on the Home Screen. Built-in private journal  reflect on your day, jot down thoughts, or track progress. Entries are dated and time stamped and stay only on your phone. Nothing goes to the cloud. Customization  darklight mode, plus any custom accent color you want so you can make it your own. Encouragement, not pressure badges without streaks, finish tasks on you time. Just small wins that feel meaningful. If youre curious, heres the Play Store link:  Here's some free promo codes to try it out. If you have any thoughts or opinions, please reach out and let me know.

      "content": "From the Japanese writers point of view, writing a long novel is like survival training. Physical strength is as necessary as artistic sensitivity, spending his days running and swimming to build up his endurance, as well as competing in marathons and triathlons. At the start of his writing career, Murakami also ran a small jazz club in Tokyo, where he worked until the early hours of the morning, before going home to write. After he decided to commit his life entirely to writing, Murakami and his wife, Yoko, closed the bar and moved out to Narashino, a more rural area in the Chiba prefecture of Tokyo. From there, the writer overhauled his lifestyle and daily routine completely, once I was sitting at a desk writing all day I started putting on the pounds. I was also smoking too muchsixty cigarettes a day. My fingers were yellow, and my body reeked of smoke. This couldnt be good for me, I decided. If I wanted to have a long life as a novelist, I needed to find a way to stay in shape. In Murakamis new daily routine, if hes in novel mode, hell wake up at 4am and immediately start writing, working for five to six hours. If hes not in novel mode, Murakami and his wife will still wake up early, once I began my life as a novelist, my wife and I decided that wed go to bed soon after it got dark and wake up with the sun, typically waking up before 5am and going to bed at 10pm. While some people may imagine the life of a writer as balancing long stretches of idleness with flash in pan inspiration moments, the reality is that writing, and creativity, is more of a steady grind. Murakmai says, I have to pound away at a rock with a chisel and dig out a deep hole before I can locate the source of my creativity  a sentiment which reflects his structured routine and lifestyle. Murakami will typically finish up his days writing at 10am or 11am. From there, hell proceed to his physical training. In the afternoon, I run for 10km or swim for 1500m (or do both), then I read a bit and listen to some music. I go to bed at 9:00 pm. I keep to this routine every day without variation. The repetition itself becomes the important thing; its a form of mesmerism. I mesmerize myself to reach a deeper state of mind. But to hold to such repetition for so long  six months to a year  requires a good amount of mental and physical strength. To read the full daily routine, check it out here:",

Now, I personally have never felt this way and am surprised about how common it is among you all. Like, if I am not motivated, nothing good is gonna come out of me anyway. If I only write 200 words, I am not immersed in the scene and will simply not hit the tone or pace needed for the whole scene. Forcing myself to write a certain amount of words daily literally lowers the quality of my texts. If I dont feel like writing, I dont. I certainly make up for it next time I am motivated because I will hammer out a full scene varying between 1k and 5k words usually. Writing is fun! It shouldnt feel like homework. Am I alone in this?",

Literally anything. You wont even notice it before your fluency in expressing feelings and ideas improves, and, more importantly, you develop a habit of writing daily. The writing obviously doesnt have to be worthy of publication, or even half decent! A stream of consciousness is okay. Stuff only understandable to you is okay. Anything more than a blank page is okay. Dont set a word quota, just pour your heart out and watch the words flow with surprising ease. Do it. This is your sign.",

I have a full-time job, and I'm a single dad, but I've always thought about writing, because I love to read and I have crazy ideas. The final assignment of the course was the first chapter of the novel idea that we had come up with. On the final day of class we were grouped in pairs of three to four students. The instructions were to read the other chapters and provide light, positive feedback. The other students work was different from mine - I was aiming for a middle grade book, they were writing adult fiction, but it was interesting to read their ideas and see their characters. The feedback I received was not light or positive though. The other students slammed my work. They said my supporting character was cold and unbelievable. They said my plot wasn't interesting. That my writing was repetitive. I asked them if they had anything positive to add and they shrugged.The professor also read the chapter and provided some brief feedback, it was mostly constructive. Nothing harsh, but it wasn't enough to overcome the other feedback. There was a nice, \"keep writing!\" note at the top of my chapter. I put it away. For two years now. I lurk on this sub, but I haven't written in the past two years. I journal and brainstorm. But I don't write. Because two people in my writing class couldn't find anything nice to say about the chapter I wrote. But fuck 'em. Which is what I should have said two years ago. If I can't take criticism, I shouldn't plan on writing anything. And I'm not going to get better if I stop anyways. So I decided to pick it back up, and I'll keep trying. Even if my characters are cold and unbelievable. Even if my plot isn't interesting. So here we are.",

Is it just to document your thoughts and to speak your mind. Is it about your day? Do you write about different topics?

I think of a diary at one side of a spectrum as more as a record of events and impressions that happened that day, where I think of a journal at the other end as more ideas, notes, drawings. You might check out some famous diaries like that of Samuel Pepys or Virginia Woolf, the journals of Lewis and Clark. Look up Journaling and you will see tons of things that people do with their little books today. Writing for yourself in these ways can make you a better writer, and can help with mental health too. Explore. Don't think that there is a right way. And most importantly remember that it isn't a competition. There are lots of well written diaries and beautiful journals, and that is great. But I will tell you mine over the years have been much more a mishmash of notes, some diary like entries, the occasional act of drawing which only I can probably identify what I drew (hopefully!). scribbles galore. But it works for me. Do you, and it will be great.",

Either way, the idea is to develop at least some level of a \"stream of consciousness\" into what you are writing. You're more likely to add believable psychology to your voice doing that than working on endless outlining and mulling over genre and \"who your audience is\". Journal away, you may find a gem hidden somewhere.",

I never write about my feelings, I've tried venting and it just makes me angry and sad. To me feelings are meant to be shared. Sometimes the heap of random stuff spits out something interesting, and I usually turn that flower of my compost heap into a story of some kind. All my best stuff comes to me this way and it's in this way I write with emotion.",

      "content": "Okay, so about half a year ago, I figured I wanted to be a writer after I came up with a brilliant idea for a book (for context, I'm 14), and I always loved reading. I've been developing this idea, brainstorming about all the different characters and scenes I wanted to have. I started writing at the end of July. About once a week, I sat down, and wrote, for just a 10 minutes or so. But recently, I realised I was pretty lazy with my work. I either had to do stuff for my school, or was on my phone (which I realised was a bad habit). So instead of playing games, I at least watched some youtube videos with advice for young writers or writers in general. And many of them said, that perhaps I should not start with my best idea. This had me thinking. The problem was, I was not only working on my best idea, but it was my ONLY idea. So I basically had no other choice, unless you count fanfiction. I thought about that for a while too, but decided it wasn't such a good idea (for me, personally). So now I came up with an idea. Maybe, the best to do is starting a diary, writing about my past and present. It is a bit different, because unlike with my idea for a book, I wouldn't like anyone to read THAT, so it wouldn't need to be even close to perfect. It would make me practicing. Also, I would never get stuck, because it's my past. But I'm still not so sure. Is this actually a good idea? I haven't seen it in any of the videos I watched, I came up with it all on my own. So what is a better thing to do than ask some of you?",

      "content": "That is stupid advice you got from Youtube. Go ahead and write what you think your best idea is. A diary is a good idea too. The key things at this point are to write a lot and read a lot with intention. What do I mean? When you notice something that works well in a bookstory, think about why it works, and journal at least part of the time about that. Figuring out what other writers do that works (or doesn't) is a key in honing your own abilities. I'm not saying you copy them; you are adding tools to your toolkit. As far as writing, you need to do it regularly. A lot of people will say write X words per day. You don't have to follow that advice. But you should try to write most days. Even when I am otherwise busy (I work 80hr a week in summer), I try to get down 100 words or more per day, which is not a lot. 500 is more aggressive but still very manageable (this is not quite two double-spaced word processor pages). Don't worry about blowing your first idea. Writing is one of those things you need to put in time and effort into learning, so your first bookstorywhatever is probably not going to be very good. Nobody's is. But here's the thing: ideas tend to be the easiest part. I have thousands of good ideas. I get new ones every day. A LOT of unfinished books out there are the author's first good idea that they keep grinding on and grinding on forever (usually the first few chapters, not even the whole thing) because it isn't \"perfect,\" when no book ever is.",

A diary is another optionbut take it from someone who wrote a short horror story at 12 with a friend by hand: writing everything with pen and paper can be tedious. That isnt to say it isnt a good writing method. I think its a bit silly to say an aspiring writer shouldnt write their first idea; we all start somewhere. A diary of your life is a good way to get in tune with yourself, and figure out what aspects of your life impact the story youre sitting on, but will you stick to it? Will you dedicate time each day to writing in it? Or would it be a waste of money on a notebook you end up keeping stashed somewhere for no one to read? If you have a story to write, begin writing it. You can trim it and add to it as time goes on. People have been published at ages as young as 12 and 13; dont let your age be something that holds you back from pursuing your writing. Begin with character development on paper or computer; shift to world building, and then make a rough draft. Youre more than capable of writing the story youve come up withyou thought of it, for Heavens sake! Dont let YouTube influence you too heavily, those creators dont know what youve concocted in your brain. Theyre giving general advice.",

I take notes when I do research and I'm trying to get everything together. My writing and structure have picked up and I think I'm taking feedback well.  I think its slowed my writing pace, but I think for the better. As I was going, with the feedback I've received my story turned out to be pretty weak as I've portrayed it. Better to sort these things out now than to trudge or blaze through a whole piece and have that much more work to do after. The way I see it, the random scenes and character interactions that pop into my head and I jot down to later incorporate are organic. This entire world is already in my head. I just need to get it on paper, whether by prose or notes, and analyze it. I am coming to a point where I'm organizing my feedback to implement it, with my notes, and just engage in some pure writing. So that's my experience. Not journaling, but outling and notes. No burnout, but a point that I no longer gain from them.",

      "content": "Im an avid reader. I usually average 100 books a year for the last 5 years or so, mostly thrillers a lot of fantasy too. I absolutely adore reading. I toyed with the idea of writing my own book, and finally decided to get myself a copy of Save the Cat!, Tome (which actually Ive found helpful despite mixed reviews) and get to work. One problem. Im not actually very good at writing thoughtful and lyrical prose. I sound stiff because Im a probation officer that writes violation reports all day long and its all super technical and boring. Im having the worst case of imposter syndrome now because I sit there and write stiff, boring sentences. Im not asking how to write better, I know theres a daily thread for that but tell me it at least improves. I feel like I cringe at myself every time I open my computer, I feel stupid for trying. Is this a normal part of the process and I just need to get over myself? Edit to add: wow! I am actually blown away by all the thoughtful, extremely helpful advice. I was somehow expecting a lot more of: get over yourself. I am reading through every comment, taking notes and gathering ideas. Thank you all so much! Its nice to know Im not alone. Its now my job to 1. Get over myself 2. Practice practice practice and 3. Give myself permission to write an awful first draft ... but most importantly, just write it! Last night I did some creative writing prompt sprints and I can already see some improvement when I remove the pressure. Ill keep at it!",

I've never bought the whole, 'we need more women in X industry' thing. If we need more people in games journalism or, where I hear it more often, engineering, then we need more people, not specifically more women. Give men and women equal opportunity to enter the field, and let those individuals make the choice to enter. When it comes to reading, whether it's novels or news articles or reviews, the only time I think about the gender of the author is if the author makes a point to mention it. Hell I read touch arcade every day, and at least skim most of the articles posted, and I can probably count on one hand the number of times I've even happened to notice the author's name. I'm sure there are a fair number of people who write for the site, but I couldn't begin to say how many or what any of their names are.",

      "content": "Update to this post( Edit: I always forget to mention this, but please join the unofficial subreddit (rletterlike)! I do post updates and listen to feedback there! Edit2: I also forgot to mention to check out some of the amazing streamsvideos on YouTube! I don't think I can post a link on here, but there are some videos posted by some awesome people! Edit3: I have to step away for a bit to take my kid to dance class, but will be back later if anyone wanted a code! Hi there! It's been some time since my last update! It's Ron again and I'm a solo dev that made Letterlike, a roguelike (probably more of a roguelite) word game that's been described as Scrabble  Spelling Bee meets Balatro. As an initial matter, I truly wanted to thank this community so much for your support! Letterlike actually held the #2 spot in Top Paid Word games on the App Store for weeks! I really can't believe it! It's also such an incredible shock that people have rated it so highly! Currently, the game has a 4.8 rating (!) in the US. Thank you so much! But to get to the main point, I've finally been able to push out Version 14 of Letterlike with some fun new features for way more content and fun ways to play to the game! I was also able to grab more free promo codes to give out so please comment below or DM me if you are interested! NOTE: If requesting a code, please state you want one for the App Store as I am getting Play Store and Steam requests right now too! You can try the demo for free here (I recently updated it a little bit but it doesn't have all the features of the full game): Play The Free Demo Here( The game is available on on the App Store below! App Store Link( Also, if interested, please wishlist on Steam (as that goes a long way!). Version 14 Updates:  Cloud Transfers: Cloud transfers are available! You will now be able to transfer between different devices. I don't know how useful this will be without the Steam version, but some folks have asked for it!  More Cards (formerly known as Items): For those already familiar with the game, there will be more Cards available that I think will really add a fun mix to the game! Also, all of the new items are unlockables and can be deactivated if you don't like any of them!  Score massive points by making palindromes, alphabetical, and double letter words with some of these Cards!  Card Unlocks: As noted above, the new Cards can be unlocked by various different conditions! I forgot to mention that any unlocked item can be deactivated if you prefer the original set!  Achievements: I included some achievements for those who really love to strive to completion  Daily Challenge: For those that are looking for a fun little challenge, you can try the daily challenge everyday, available at midnight local time! They're going to be a mix of most of the bags and difficulties with a cap for the amount of gems you can use so use them wisely! The new items will not be available in the daily challenges.  Note: the challenges ran during the Steam playtest but has been reset starting today!  Leaderboards: Are you pretty good at Letterlike? I don't know how many people will actually be interested in the Leaderboards, but now's your chance to finally able to put that to the test! Each of the daily challenges will have a daily leaderboard to see where you stack up.  Draggable: For those that like to drag, the words can now be dragged on the board to rearrange to make the most powerful words! Coming Soon:  Bricks! What are bricks? They're a new tile type that can be used to fill in a slot on the board and extend the length of the word! This way you can not only place your biggest letters on the right place on the board (with that juicy 12xL) but you can also make 9, 10, 11, 12 letter words with far less actual letters! I've been playing around with this idea and it's a lot of fun! I have been struggling with how to get 12 letter words more viable, and I believe this will be it!  More Cards! Of course, more Cards will always be added! I'm always looking for some fresh ideas so let me know if you have any!  Tablet Support! This will come soon! I just need to make some additional page art. I'm afraid tablet will only be in landscape though. Anyway, hope you have fun! If you want a code, let me know!",

The front cover looks like an actual front cover of a journal. If the app has a lock on the front cover that unlocks when you type in your password, that would be cool. The same goes for choosing different fonts and changing the font size, adding pictures... If anyone knows one (if anything like that even exists) please share links or recommendations.

A convenient feature is the CSV import. With that, you can reuse any existing mood data you may have already collected. But also the entry creation is easy: set your mood, select from icons what you've been up to, and add a photo, location or a note. If you want, you can also do that from your Apple Watch (WearOS support is planned for the future). The app will let you then analyze your mood and give hints what may trigger you in a positive or negative way. There's also a PDF export feature, which you can use if you want to print your diary. Since I'm always looking for ways to improve my app, any comments, suggestions and ideas are more than welcome. Thanks for reading and have an awesome day! :) P.S. The colors you see in the screenshots is a preview for one of the 2 new themes coming with the next update.",

The app should be able to track all the times you went to this hiking group and preferably, allow you to add notes like \"Jared was a cool guy\", \"Loved this hiking trail, hated that one\"? - A long-term goal, say getting a new job, so something like this: Main Goal: New Job Subsets: Networking Event  Submit Resumes And say the calendar has something like 3 networking events that month and 5 reminders to submit resumes, is there an app that can show you all the \"subsets\" for \"New Job\" and list them somewhere?",

For meeting assignment deadlines while also not losing sight of routine tasks that need to be done. The app would need to be able to define a task like \"vocabulary practice 3x a week for 30 minutes, repeat every week\" then report \"you've done this only once so far.\" It should be able to display in a way that the deadline tasks are easily distinguishable from the others. So you can see where you are lacking and prioritize your next steps. Any suggestions?",

      "content": "Have we forgotten what having a personal diary is all about. Journaling is a very personal matter. It comes from within, if someone is stuck in their journaling routine. Or if someone is not doing it often doe to any reason what so ever, AI has no place in driving or motivating a person. Because, that totally defeats the purpose of putting your personal thoughts, your brainstorming, your plans on to an external medium. Its intimate and its personal. Only through personal introspective can a journal entry be truly be meaningful, otherwise its coerced, and this just so wrong. Not everything needs to have AI. On that note I would recommend one app that I have been using for almost a decade. Do checkout Daylio, the app even has its on dedicated subreddit. No AI gimmicks and no ridiculous notifications and you can disable them without worry.",

      "content": "(reposted from rtechsupport) Good morning everyone! I don't use Reddit that often, but this time I desperately need help. I have had a diary app called Universum since 2018. My daily diaries are something I hold really close to my heart, so I had invested on a Premium account on the app, which allowed me to access its cloud. This meant that even when I changed my phone, I could easily download the app on another phone, enter my account with a mail, and have access all of my previous diaries. This time around, however, I couldn't do this. After breaking my old phone and buying a new one, I couldn't find Universum on the new one's Play Store. I have tried on different phones too, but no such luck. The app has disappeared from everywhere. I have contacted the \"developers\" through an email I found on a poorly designed website online, but they didn't respond. I have also tried downloading the APK file from different websites, but despite logging into my account, my old diaries weren't there. Luckily, I had downloaded PDFs of my diaries from the previous years, but I'm missing ones from this year and the end of last year. If anyone still has Universum downloaded on their phone, I am willing to give you access to my account just to restore these diaries. Any other suggestion on what I should do (or what precautions I should take to share my account info safely) is welcome. Thank you! (excuse my poor English, I'm Italian and don't know IT lingo that well...)",
