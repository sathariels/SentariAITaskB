I believe the Android alternative for this is Journey, but I still went with Day One. I'm kind of obsessed at the moment. The ability to have multiple journals (premium features) is really nice. Seeing my streaks makes me not want to miss a day, but really... I just look forward to journaling now. I always thought of myself as a paperpen journal person, but digital is just more convenient for me. I just wished they had a mood tracker. But yes, I'm loving it so far!",

You can also purchase your journal entries as a printed book, which Ive tried out once and was happy with.",

      "content": "7 months ago, my journal got read by my partner. I noticed their replies were off while texting them at work but I wasn't sure what had happened. They asked if there was anything I'd like to tell them, confused, I pressed until they asked if there was anything I'd written in my journal. Whatever I wrote is irrelevant. A journal is meant to be a safe space to process the world around me. Happy, sad, angry, doesn't matter. Process. My partner took that feeling of security from me. I've been journalling for years and I've never felt as insecure as I've felt this year putting my thoughts on paper. Journalling has been the anchor for my functionality; I spiralled this year because for 5 months after my journal was \"raided\", I was unable to journal. I picked up journalling again in May. It's been inconsistent; I've not been able to shake off the feeling of insecurity. To regain that feeling of security, I thought of using a redacting pen this month. I don't have that yet but I want to journal consistently again, and that means feeling safe. I've gone back through my current journal and scribbled out my entries. I scanned my entries before doing that so I could always have some memory of my entries. I hated the scribbling, it goes against what I believe a journal should be, but it's where I'm at. I guess I'm looking for solidarity. Have you had issues with security and how did you get through to that?",

      "content": "I'm so sorry. Having your journal read against your will or knowledge is a betrayal. Especially if it's done by someone you love and who should know better. My parents regularly betrayed my trust that way when I was a teenager. They thought nothing of it. In fact, my father told me to my face just last month that he went through an affirmations journal I'd kept last year because \"it had fallen on the floor and was open\". To put this in context, I'm in my late 20s now. All this time and all those years and they still do not know what they did wrong. I don't know if your partner journals, but my parents dont- so maybe it's a non-journaler thing. They don't know what it means to be vulnerable and so they don't see they're exploiting someone's vulnerability. Or maybe it's a certain type of person thing, because I can't for the life of me understand how someone can't realize it. All this to say- I don't think this is a problem that will go away. Not unless you and your partner are willing to have a very frank discussion about what they did. And not if your partner doesn't respect your boundaries and your privacy. I dealt with it (as a teenager) by crying, yelling, trying to hide my journals which would inevitably be ferreted out by my parents, and then creating a whole new written language system to write in instead when I eventually realized that security was non-existent. I dealt with it last month by walking out of the room midway through my father telling me he'd betrayed my trust yet again. He's not someone you can have open discussions with so there was no point in trying. Physically exiting out of the conversation was an act of self-preservation. I take my journal wherever I go now. And I hide it in better places when I have to leave it behind. It is what it is. The thought of you scribbling out your previous entries hurts my heart. I hope you find your way through this, OP.",

In the mornings I'll write out my plans, maybe some thoughts, some gratitude, stuff like that.. and in my night journal I'll talk about what I did that day and how it made me feel, how I felt overall, general thoughts, etc. I used to JUST journal stream-of-consciousness but found that I'd only do it when I had negative things to say. I made it a priority to also note down positive things and I think it's helped me have a more positive approach to each day. It also is nice to see my thoughts organized on paper, helps me keep a clear head. I incorporate stickers and some art (although I do have a section solely for sketches) to make it look pretty. I find it fun and relaxing and it honestly gives me something to look forward to upon waking up.",

I personally own a daily journal where I write line by line, I'm not the best at writing down just agendas or titles like \"Got a new scarf!\" as a one-liner. I prefer writing the full story of my day down, my thoughts about it and all that so basically word vomiting on my daily pages. Although I also have a planner on the front pages of my journal where I jot down weekly plans, somewhat! Just so I can have a personal tracker",

That works for me. Spreads might work for you. Just do what you want. you dont have to journal everyday...I do most days but I know not doing it for a day or two isnt a huge deal I just do it when I feel like it. Ive been doing this for so long I feel like I cant not do it but that took years to build up to. Start with once or twice a week and build from there. journaling is so romanticized nowadays it blows my mind...you dont need to think through everything you write down. Some of my entries dont even make sense when I go back to look at them. Most of it is just me complaining with the rare nugget of good advice Ive received or growth in my character I can recognize or life lessons but thats life for me and thats life for most people. your life is most likely not a coming of age novel! you dont need to write in your journal like its one! I want to look back on my journals when Im older and see an accurate view of my life, not a romanticized one. I think one of the most valuable things about writing your life is being able to look back on it all with older eyes, you get a deeper look at yourself and its found in those boring mundane entries you might feel arent good enough or whatever all in all just stop complicating everything...journals dont have to be pretty or deep or perfect, theyre meant to be a reflection of you and your life. just roll with it and write whatever comes to mind, your older self will thank you for the insight. I started seriously journaling when I was 12, Im 21 now and I think Im a more well rounded and emotionally intelligent person because my 12 year old self decided to write everyday. The best part about this is virtually anybody can do it. seriously, JUST START WRITING.",

I hate subscriptions but is 3 bucks enough to net you a lifetime of support? - Most photo formats dont actually display a thumbnail, for example HEIF from your iPhone doesnt display. All that said it does have one of the best file attachment systems that I wish other journal apps would emulate. Keeping an eye on this one!",

This took a decade to get there, but they eventually did, and I switched to Reminders full time a year or two ago. The native-OSSiri integration can't be touched by a third party app. I imagine Diary will be the same way. Bare bones, with a few features only a native-Apple app can possibly have.

I also discovered I'm much more affected by sleep and diet than I realized. Bad days almost always correlate with poor sleep or junky meals. Seeing these patterns written out made them impossible to ignore. Now I'm actually addressing root causes instead of just reacting to symptoms. Simple but powerful tool.",

This piece, Elevate, is me putting those thoughts into words, about growth, challenges, and the decision to step into my own power before hitting the next decade. # Elevate Who wouldve thought Id be sitting on the edge of 30, same old baggage being carried up the same old staircase. I did. My third eye has shown me my future more times than I can remember, pointing out those same old flaws begging me to get rid. I was waiting patiently for the Lord to give me the answers, until I ran out of patience to give. No one told me I was supposed to go and find the answers, that arrogance has been expensive. You dont know the things I've almost lost from losing myself, or maybe you do. Maybe theres other people out there only caked in failure, and they know what I've been through. But that companionship is empty because wrong is still wrong, and Id rather be lonely than fit in somewhere I dont belong. Maybe your mistakes define you, but I wasnt sent here for mediocrity. My mistakes have been lessons, and I've been skipping class for too long. 29-30 is 365 days to become dangerous, find MY north star, and elevate. Stars are out of reach only for those who impose things on themselves that keep them grounded. But me? I elevate. Some will join me. Some might fall short. Many will try to tear me down, and yet still, I elevate. I rise. I break. I shift. I elevate. And when all is said and done, the ghost that once haunted me will give me the nod of approval because my third eye is still showing me my future. Its seen the shift, changed the trajectories, because truly, this is the season, that I elevate.",

You name it, I tried it:  4am cold showers (lasted 3 days)  200 on meditation apps I never opened  Every YouTube guru's \"morning routine\"  Journaling (my notebook has 2 entries)  Those motivational IG pages that post wolves None of it stuck because I was lying to myself. I wasn't actually trying to improve - I was trying to feel better about not improving. Then I found stoicism through some random YouTube video. Started with Meditations (didn't understand half of it lol). But something clicked. These weren't some 20-year-old tiktokers telling me to \"rise and grind\" - these were emperors and slaves who actually lived this shit. The harsh truth? I wasn't failing because of circumstances. I was failing because: 1. I blamed everything except myself 2. I thought watching motivation videos  taking action 3. I was addicted to comfort while pretending to want growth Real change started when I stopped looking for inspiration and started facing reality. Been diving deeper into stoicism lately (Marcus Aurelius on a Stoic Chat app roasted my victim mentality at 2AM last week lmao). But the biggest shift happened when I finally accepted that:  Motivation is bullshit. You either do it or you don't  Your environment shapes you. I deleted social media, cut toxic friends  Comfort is the enemy. If it doesn't make you uncomfortable, it's not growth  You know what to do. You're just avoiding it 6 months later:  Got my first real job  Started actually going to the gym (not just buying gym clothes)  Having real conversations instead of avoiding conflict  Actually reading books instead of saving \"how to read more\" videos Stop lying to yourself. You're not stuck - you're hiding.",

Saw this study from Heidelberg University that said your brain can start to rewire itself after just three days of reduced phone usage. Not 21 days. Not 90. Just 3. That number kind of stuck with me. Felt do-able. I didnt delete my apps or anything. Just blocked access to the stuff I usually open on autopilot, Reddit, Insta, news, etc. and only allowed 4 unblocks per day. After 3 days I actually didnt want to go back to my previous baseline. After day 3, I kept going. I was sleeping better. Felt less scatterbrained. I actually reached for a book for the first time in forever. I started doing walks after dinner instead of scrolling. And I noticed this little shift in how present I felt, like I wasnt constantly buzzing in the background. It was like a snowball effect, once I started I kept finding more times in the day I could replace with better things. Heres how I did it:  Used an app blocker so I had to be intentional about when I did use my phone  Kept my phone in another room at night  Picked a couple things to replace the scroll (books, long showers, walks, journaling)  Told myself I only had to make it 3 days That tiny window made it way more approachable. Im two weeks in now, and still going strong. Its not like I dont use my phone at all, I still average like 45mins to 1hour on social but its much less obsessive. Highly recommend trying it if youre stuck in a scroll spiral.",

      "content": "For years, I tortured myself with failed habits. Meditation? 3 days and done. Journaling? A notebook with 10 sad pages collecting dust. Cold showers? Painful, but pointless. I thought I was lazy. Turns out, I was just fighting the way my brain works. Heres what finally clicked: 1. Your brain hates habits but loves patterns I used to wait for the perfect reading setup: comfy chair, quiet room, good lighting. That moment never came. So I shifted. Instead of mindlessly watch videos and posts on commutes, lunch breaks, or waiting rooms, I read. Result? 3 books in 3 months. Not record-breaking, but a personal win. 2. Systems  willpower Blank pages killed my journaling attempts. Not knowing where to start  instant shutdown, I felt completely lost. Then I realized: my brain resists decisions, not writing. I researched decision fatigue so I built this daily note structure:  Capture  What caught my attention today?  Connect  Why does it matter? Does it link to a projectgoal?  Next step  Is there an action, or just something worth keeping?  Top 3 Objectives  Task Backlog (auto-shows todays tasks by priority)  Completed Today (auto-log of done tasks)  Reflection  Whats going well? Whats blocking me?  Tomorrows Objectives Thats it. No essays. Just fill in the blanks. Ideas stop floating in sticky notes, apps, and land in one trusted place (for me, its digital, but a notebook works too). Over time, daily notes become a web of insights tied to what I actually care about. 3.Progress  perfection My gym system is stupidly simple: Show up. Stretch if Im not feeling it. Let momentum decide. 80 of the time, I lift. 20 I just walk. Either way  a win When you design around your actual behaviors (instead of copying routines off social media), progress stops feeling like punishment. Habits still matter, but when a system absorbs them and gives them a direction (you build it), they stop being a battle. They just... run in the background. Nonetheless, if you try to to do something that definetely doesn't resonate with you, your goals, values, etc. It doesn't matter if you build the most complex and seamless system, you will still not do it. So, this applies just when you care about achieving something (doesn't matter if it is really heart, you will figure out how to do it :) ) What has worked for you to make your goals happen?",

The front cover looks like an actual front cover of a journal. If the app has a lock on the front cover that unlocks when you type in your password, that would be cool. The same goes for choosing different fonts and changing the font size, adding pictures... If anyone knows one (if anything like that even exists) please share links or recommendations.

The idea is to use existing tools to just start writing, and have the records automatically arranged in a specified folder. Please check out the project here:  and let me know if there are any changes or improvements you guys would like to see. I haven't yet tested this on mac and other Unix systems, so it would be great to get some feedback on those platforms as well. Thanks",

I'd like to assign categories or labels to entries, e.g. people that appeared in that dream (or specific places or feelings).

It also needs to be able to mark up PDFs like GoodNotes can. I would use the Windows version of GoodNotes, but it's only online and my school has bad internet. Windows Journal doesn't have text and I need to be able to type on slides and stuff. Inkodo works well enough, though I'm just wondering if there's anything better because I find it clunky to use and the text feature is very finnicky especially since you can't properly adjust the font sizes or set default text options like with GoodNotes. Though I can deal with that if there are no alternatives.",

      "content": "Tl;dr: Inkodo is probably your best bet. Mark up apps on Windows for note-taking isn't great. I'm not sure if you're still looking for a solution, but to be honest, Inkodo is the best solution I've found for handwriting notes (and I have similar requirements as you). For reference, I'm currently using a non-graphic drawing tablet (I've shifted over from a touch screen windows 2-1 laptop with pen support). I've tried countless apps (Inkodo, Obsidian, OneNote, Drawboard, Goodnotes, Xournal, Xournal, Bamboo Paper, Xodo, Edge, Nebo, Microsoft Journal, Scrbl Ink, and MANY others I can't even remember) on my previous laptop and a couple on this drawing pad. Drawboard and Goodnotes were great for me years ago before they started limiting basic features behind paywalls, became bug ridden, slow, and subscription based. OneNote has the best pen support by far and it's not even a competition, but the lack of features, bugs, failing to sync occasionally (safer to use offline imo), among other things made it a no go for me. In the end, I went with Inkodo because it best suit my needs (no infinite scroll, PDF support, organized, no major bugs, decent customizability and tools). It's not a perfect app but it's the \"best\" app out of the bunch for me. The runner-ups I remember that are worth checking out are XournalXournal and Scrbl Ink (lite version). Bamboo Paper was insanely fast iirc compared to a lot of the other apps, but I found the app a little too basic for my liking and it didn't support importing PDFs when I tested it.",

My reddit usage definitely went overboard last night   Sorry for the S23 and Z Fold 5 users that had their phones crash. :( What is Habitually( A Frankenstein accounting tool for your life. Its majority journal  habit tracker app combined with a mood diary. Play Store Link( Features  Benefits Journaling Track whatever action or event in your day. Like simple yes or no answers to stats like reddit usage or tea intake. A key benefit is the simplicity I have developed after 2 years of my own usage, which until recently I am finally happy with. A good case study is a reddit post showing 200 actions that I recorded daily in a year: Post in question( (A lot of people wonder but the time using the app is less than 5 mins daily.) Mood diary Instead of having 20 words to define your happiness. I split happiness into 3 pillars:  Mental well-being  Physical well-being  Social well-being Being wider reaching, even if you feel happy emotionally, there is nuance in knowing if that coincided with beneficialnegative physical or social feelings. Others  CSV, JSON export at any time  Reminders on a weekly, monthly or custom timeframe  Lots of stats and charts  On device machine learning (not a chat-gpt wrapper), calculates from every journal and mood entry the impact of your actions on your life  lots more Play Store Link( Website( Pricing Freemium - Full access with ads Similar to the Spotify model, one rewarded ad covers one day of usage. I am not interested in creating artificial barriers of access, the ads simply cover any costs for usage so everyone gets worry free storage and syncing. Month 0.79 (9.48yr) Year 9.49 (0.79mo) Lifetime 14.99 or 11.99 if bought within 2 weeks of creating an account. For fun and a laugh, the same rewarded ad you can watch in the settings screen extends the month and year subscription by a day. Stats and how its going after a year From incompetence and a hatred of marketing: 500 downloads - Most from a single post I made in April. 40 DAU (fluctuates - 10) 6 retention for long term use is kinda cool. Update Plan  Playground screen - customisable charts or models to find relationships in your life.  Multiple reminders - some way for each action to have more than one reminder.  Less show and more tell - want to explain charts and stats instead of simply dumping them on a screen  Swap between NightLight theme. The app already follows the device theme but doing this in app would be useful. This is my first serious project with a worldwide audience with just as much variety in devices and OS. So making Habitually work for anyone anywhere is a huge priority. If you want, how you can help Being obsessed with Habitually I naturally have blind spots. Additionally, everyone is not me and have their own tastesideas so go nuts with the feedback or ideas. Where you can reach me:  Email:   Message me here on reddit or comment on this post if it will publicly benefit people PROMO CODES The lifetime codes given are permanent unless you delete the associated account. They are redeemed in-app - settings screen - promo code section (close to the bottom of the screen) I'll check for blatantly obvious bot accounts before sending them via dms. Edit 1: Progress: 80 of the way. Sorry for taking so long. Especially sorry for a Samsung S23 user who had a crash. Will work to be better :( Edit 2: Progress Last 10 to go. Sorry for anyone kept waiting, I'm about to call it for the night. Somehow Samsung are struggling as a Z Fold 5 has crashed too. Which I will look into as my brother has that phone. I use a S20 Ultra, own a S8 and S10, so these crashes are of my own fault and not a weird Android Behaviour. Luckily that also means there is a fix that won't be too hard. Edit 3: And all the codes are done. We can take this off reddit now. So any feedback or ideas emailed to me at:  will be rewarded with a Lifetime Subscription",

It's meant to help with getting your personal daily goals done as well as giving you random tasks to complete to make you feel better about your day and encourage social interactions Heres what it does: Daily challenges by category  pick from areas like mindfulness, creativity, kindness, or fitness. The app randomly generates tasks so you always have something fresh. Custom lists  make your own to-do lists, create your own personal challenges, routines, or even chore lists. You can switch between random prompts and your own tasks anytime on the Home Screen. Built-in private journal  reflect on your day, jot down thoughts, or track progress. Entries are dated and time stamped and stay only on your phone. Nothing goes to the cloud. Customization  darklight mode, plus any custom accent color you want so you can make it your own. Encouragement, not pressure badges without streaks, finish tasks on you time. Just small wins that feel meaningful. If youre curious, heres the Play Store link:  Here's some free promo codes to try it out. If you have any thoughts or opinions, please reach out and let me know. If you enjoy it, please leave a review!

Or if someone is not doing it often doe to any reason what so ever, AI has no place in driving or motivating a person. Because, that totally defeats the purpose of putting your personal thoughts, your brainstorming, your plans on to an external medium. Its intimate and its personal. Only through personal introspective can a journal entry be truly be meaningful, otherwise its coerced, and this just so wrong. Not everything needs to have AI. On that note I would recommend one app that I have been using for almost a decade. Do checkout Daylio, the app even has its on dedicated subreddit.

      "content": "(reposted from rtechsupport) Good morning everyone! I don't use Reddit that often, but this time I desperately need help. I have had a diary app called Universum since 2018. My daily diaries are something I hold really close to my heart, so I had invested on a Premium account on the app, which allowed me to access its cloud. This meant that even when I changed my phone, I could easily download the app on another phone, enter my account with a mail, and have access all of my previous diaries. This time around, however, I couldn't do this. After breaking my old phone and buying a new one, I couldn't find Universum on the new one's Play Store. I have tried on different phones too, but no such luck. The app has disappeared from everywhere. I have contacted the \"developers\" through an email I found on a poorly designed website online, but they didn't respond. I have also tried downloading the APK file from different websites, but despite logging into my account, my old diaries weren't there. Luckily, I had downloaded PDFs of my diaries from the previous years, but I'm missing ones from this year and the end of last year. If anyone still has Universum downloaded on their phone, I am willing to give you access to my account just to restore these diaries. Any other suggestion on what I should do (or what precautions I should take to share my account info safely) is welcome. Thank you! (excuse my poor English, I'm Italian and don't know IT lingo that well...)",

Clinically grounded content, APA references, real tools, not fluff. Looking for feedback and early users. Hi! I built two mobile apps completely solo, after hours, with no funding and Id never shipped a mobile app before. Short backstory: Im a cognitive science grad who drifted into tech and mostly worked with data. It wasnt quite the right fit for me, so I decided to build something closer to my core interestsand actually useful. I learned Flutter in a few days and started building. I ended up with two apps:  Velora Student: for Polish high schools (access-code only).  Velora (public edition): a separate version with slightly different content and features. Why two? I want schools to get Velora for free. The public version is meant to cover the costs. Pricing is simple: 30 of content is free, the rest is a monthly subscription. No dark patterns, no tricks. Status: both apps are live on Android and iOS, Polish-only for now. Im not doing auto-translationsthis is personal, and Im careful about content quality. Every section and exercise is backed by clinical literature, with an in-app Scientific basis area (APA-style references, PubMed links, etc.). # Whats inside (public edition)  Clinical psychological questionnaires with clear, high-quality result visualizations.  Self-help programs across multiple therapeutic models.  Therapeutic exercises only from officialvalidated methods (no made-up stuff).  Weekly check-ins across 9 bio-psycho-social areas.  Weekly challenges generated from program content.  CBT journals, e.g., an automatic thoughts journal.  Dashboards summarizing your check-ins over time.  Verified database of free support in Poland (free hotlines, crisis centers), filterable by voivodeship.  Daily side quests (a small card draw with simple, helpful tasks). # Extra for schools (Velora Student  counselor layer)  Anonymous chat with the school psychologist.  Psychologist dashboard to streamline work.  Send test results to the school psychologist.  Book appointments with the school psychologist.  Incident reporting and crisis messages.  Aggregated results and well-being reports for schools. What I need: Id love feedback. Id love users. I cant run ads coz Im broke. My hope is to keep the school edition free and fund it with the public app. If youre in Poland and you try it even one install helps. If you work in a school (psychologist, teacher, admin) and want to pilot it, lets talk. The screenshots youll see are from the current build. The apps still need work, and Ill keep pushing until theyre the best in their category. Website: velora.pl( App store (public version):  Google Play (public version):  Thanks for reading",

      "content": "Hey rapps So I got tired of juggling between Google Photos, Maps, Notes, and trying to remember \"wait, what did I do after that cafe in Paris?\" when telling travel stories. Built this app called Groute that automatically connects your photos by location and time to create visual travel routes. Here's the hook: Just upload your travel photos  GPS data creates your journey path automatically  Add quick 30-character thoughts  Share as beautiful web pages that friends can actually explore. Think of it as your travel memories getting the \"connect the dots\" treatment, but way cooler. What makes it different:  Your route appears instantly as you add photos (no manual plotting!)  Map-first approach - location is the main navigation, not date folders  30-character limit on notes (forces you to capture the essence, not write essays)  Creates shareable journey pages that work like mini travel guides Built this because I'm convinced that location  time  moment  perfect travel memory, and most apps only handle one of these well. Currently in beta and would genuinely love to get some feedback from fellow travelers who actually get the pain of organizing travel memories! If you're interested in trying it out, comment below or DM me! Especially looking for feedback from people who travel frequently or have that \"I have 10,000 unorganized travel photos\" problem. What do you think? Does this solve a real problem or am I just overthinking travel journaling?  P.S. - The app shows Paris in the screenshots but works anywhere your phone can GPS tag photos. Been testing it everywhere from Seoul coffee shops to Patagonian highways!",

The idea came from my own struggles where I wanted a nice app to journal more, but typing felt like a chore, and I didnt love the idea of my thoughts being stored in plaintext on someones server. With Parlo, you just tap a button, talk for a bit, and it automatically transcribes and summarizes your thoughts. Everything is fully encrypted. Highlights:   Voice-powered journaling   End-to-end encryption   Light emotional summaries which don't feel like generic AI bs (I hope they don't at least)   Minimalist, calming design with no ads, no clutter, and no paywall. Its free to try, and Id love feedback if anyone checks it out. It's still very early and as a solo dev I'm always looking for ways to improve Thanks a bunch!",

I've never bought the whole, 'we need more women in X industry' thing. If we need more people in games journalism or, where I hear it more often, engineering, then we need more people, not specifically more women. Give men and women equal opportunity to enter the field, and let those individuals make the choice to enter. When it comes to reading, whether it's novels or news articles or reviews, the only time I think about the gender of the author is if the author makes a point to mention it. Hell I read touch arcade every day, and at least skim most of the articles posted, and I can probably count on one hand the number of times I've even happened to notice the author's name. I'm sure there are a fair number of people who write for the site, but I couldn't begin to say how many or what any of their names are.",

Its fascinating to see how one small shift can throw everything off. Cause and effect. Chain reactions.. I wanted to find a game that captured that energy. Not just a typical paper-trading app, but the feeling of navigating a live system. Most of what I found felt like cute toys with a stock chart skin... Nothing that actually made you think, adapt, or feel pressure. Thats where District 47 started. When I started building, I was starting from zero. No game dev background, no real plan. Just a clear vision which turned into an obsession. I taught myself everything. Broke a lot of stuff. Fixed it. Broke it again. And over time, it just became part of my routine. Its been over seven months now, working every day, and Im still just as obsessed with this project as I was when I started. I appreciate everyone whos sent feedback, wrote App Store reviews, and show support. Thank you! And whether youre here to learn about markets, rare gems, or just killing time, Im glad youre part of it. This is the first of a series of journals. Ill be sharing more soon. Like, what is currently working, whats not, whats next, and how Im keeping it alive as a solo dev.",

Literally anything. You wont even notice it before your fluency in expressing feelings and ideas improves, and, more importantly, you develop a habit of writing daily. The writing obviously doesnt have to be worthy of publication, or even half decent! A stream of consciousness is okay. Stuff only understandable to you is okay. Anything more than a blank page is okay. Dont set a word quota, just pour your heart out and watch the words flow with surprising ease. Do it. This is your sign.",

I have a full-time job, and I'm a single dad, but I've always thought about writing, because I love to read and I have crazy ideas. The final assignment of the course was the first chapter of the novel idea that we had come up with. On the final day of class we were grouped in pairs of three to four students. The instructions were to read the other chapters and provide light, positive feedback. The other students work was different from mine - I was aiming for a middle grade book, they were writing adult fiction, but it was interesting to read their ideas and see their characters. The feedback I received was not light or positive though. The other students slammed my work. They said my supporting character was cold and unbelievable. They said my plot wasn't interesting. That my writing was repetitive. I asked them if they had anything positive to add and they shrugged.The professor also read the chapter and provided some brief feedback, it was mostly constructive. Nothing harsh, but it wasn't enough to overcome the other feedback. There was a nice, \"keep writing!\" note at the top of my chapter. I put it away. For two years now. I lurk on this sub, but I haven't written in the past two years. I journal and brainstorm. But I don't write. Because two people in my writing class couldn't find anything nice to say about the chapter I wrote. But fuck 'em. Which is what I should have said two years ago. If I can't take criticism, I shouldn't plan on writing anything. And I'm not going to get better if I stop anyways. So I decided to pick it back up, and I'll keep trying. Even if my characters are cold and unbelievable. Even if my plot isn't interesting. So here we are.",

Thing is, at least early on, I want my protagonist to see him that way, but not necessarily my readers. I dont want him to be a full-on pov character, but I have considered the idea of starting or ending chapters with journal entries from his pov, to give a bit more of a window into his mind. I know that having him be flawed early on provides ample opportunity for character development, but I dont want readers to give up on him before he starts to open up. Do you think short journal entries written from his perspective (although not necessarily outright telling the audience that its him, just letting them figure it out) could be a good way to help them get to know him, or is that just a lazy cop-out technique when I should be able to make his more likeable qualities come through without delving into his pov at all? Thanks for any advice or suggestions you can offer; please be kind .",

They were very brief journal entries. Generally I think there are probably more effective ways to characterize your deuteragonist, but maybe thats just my personal preference. If youre going to do the journal thing, the main thing for me to not be annoyed by it is make sure the character writing the entries is one I am invested in and intrigued by. Obviously easier said than done, but point being that journal entries are annoying for characters I dont care about, and toleratedenjoyable for characters I do care about.

I think of a diary at one side of a spectrum as more as a record of events and impressions that happened that day, where I think of a journal at the other end as more ideas, notes, drawings. You might check out some famous diaries like that of Samuel Pepys or Virginia Woolf, the journals of Lewis and Clark. Look up Journaling and you will see tons of things that people do with their little books today. Writing for yourself in these ways can make you a better writer, and can help with mental health too. Explore. Don't think that there is a right way. And most importantly remember that it isn't a competition. There are lots of well written diaries and beautiful journals, and that is great. But I will tell you mine over the years have been much more a mishmash of notes, some diary like entries, the occasional act of drawing which only I can probably identify what I drew (hopefully!). scribbles galore. But it works for me. Do you, and it will be great.",

Either way, the idea is to develop at least some level of a \"stream of consciousness\" into what you are writing. You're more likely to add believable psychology to your voice doing that than working on endless outlining and mulling over genre and \"who your audience is\". Journal away, you may find a gem hidden somewhere.",

I never write about my feelings, I've tried venting and it just makes me angry and sad. To me feelings are meant to be shared. Sometimes the heap of random stuff spits out something interesting, and I usually turn that flower of my compost heap into a story of some kind.

I've been developing this idea, brainstorming about all the different characters and scenes I wanted to have. I started writing at the end of July. About once a week, I sat down, and wrote, for just a 10 minutes or so. But recently, I realised I was pretty lazy with my work. I either had to do stuff for my school, or was on my phone (which I realised was a bad habit). So instead of playing games, I at least watched some youtube videos with advice for young writers or writers in general. And many of them said, that perhaps I should not start with my best idea. This had me thinking. The problem was, I was not only working on my best idea, but it was my ONLY idea. So I basically had no other choice, unless you count fanfiction. I thought about that for a while too, but decided it wasn't such a good idea (for me, personally). So now I came up with an idea. Maybe, the best to do is starting a diary, writing about my past and present. It is a bit different, because unlike with my idea for a book, I wouldn't like anyone to read THAT, so it wouldn't need to be even close to perfect. It would make me practicing. Also, I would never get stuck, because it's my past. But I'm still not so sure. Is this actually a good idea? I haven't seen it in any of the videos I watched, I came up with it all on my own. So what is a better thing to do than ask some of you?",

The key things at this point are to write a lot and read a lot with intention. What do I mean? When you notice something that works well in a bookstory, think about why it works, and journal at least part of the time about that. Figuring out what other writers do that works (or doesn't) is a key in honing your own abilities. I'm not saying you copy them; you are adding tools to your toolkit. As far as writing, you need to do it regularly. A lot of people will say write X words per day. You don't have to follow that advice. But you should try to write most days. Even when I am otherwise busy (I work 80hr a week in summer), I try to get down 100 words or more per day, which is not a lot. 500 is more aggressive but still very manageable (this is not quite two double-spaced word processor pages). Don't worry about blowing your first idea. Writing is one of those things you need to put in time and effort into learning, so your first bookstorywhatever is probably not going to be very good. Nobody's is. But here's the thing: ideas tend to be the easiest part. I have thousands of good ideas. I get new ones every day. A LOT of unfinished books out there are the author's first good idea that they keep grinding on and grinding on forever (usually the first few chapters, not even the whole thing) because it isn't \"perfect,\" when no book ever is.",

A diary is another optionbut take it from someone who wrote a short horror story at 12 with a friend by hand: writing everything with pen and paper can be tedious. That isnt to say it isnt a good writing method. I think its a bit silly to say an aspiring writer shouldnt write their first idea; we all start somewhere. A diary of your life is a good way to get in tune with yourself, and figure out what aspects of your life impact the story youre sitting on, but will you stick to it? Will you dedicate time each day to writing in it? Or would it be a waste of money on a notebook you end up keeping stashed somewhere for no one to read? If you have a story to write, begin writing it. You can trim it and add to it as time goes on. People have been published at ages as young as 12 and 13; dont let your age be something that holds you back from pursuing your writing. Begin with character development on paper or computer; shift to world building, and then make a rough draft. Youre more than capable of writing the story youve come up withyou thought of it, for Heavens sake! Dont let YouTube influence you too heavily, those creators dont know what youve concocted in your brain. Theyre giving general advice.",

I was thinking maybe posting it on my own website, but then I would have to bring people to it and pay for one and this is just a hobby not ment to make any money. Maybe I should post it in the comic section of Tapas? But its word heavy and not really a comic or graphic novel so idk",

I take notes when I do research and I'm trying to get everything together. My writing and structure have picked up and I think I'm taking feedback well.  I think its slowed my writing pace, but I think for the better. As I was going, with the feedback I've received my story turned out to be pretty weak as I've portrayed it. Better to sort these things out now than to trudge or blaze through a whole piece and have that much more work to do after. The way I see it, the random scenes and character interactions that pop into my head and I jot down to later incorporate are organic. This entire world is already in my head. I just need to get it on paper, whether by prose or notes, and analyze it. I am coming to a point where I'm organizing my feedback to implement it, with my notes, and just engage in some pure writing. So that's my experience. Not journaling, but outling and notes. No burnout, but a point that I no longer gain from them.",

Until now, I've only published a few short stories and won a couple contests. I've been writing since I was seven when I began my first journal. I ran a blog for fifteen years where I wrote daily. I can go and read those early posts and see how far I've come as a writer. I'm 48. I'm still getting better. Writing is a craft and the writer you are today is not the writer you will be tomorrow. Every piece you work on, every sentence you hate, every horrible choice, they all make you better. None of it is a waste of time. Every word will bring you to the place you need to be. Tell your fucking story. Tell it as best you can in as few words as possible and knock us all out with your commitment, your willingness to fail, and your bullheaded attempt at doing the hard thing. Don't quit. Finish the draft. Throw all the garbage cliches you can into that draft. Make it ugly. Let it be the worst thing you've ever written in your life. Just finish it. You'll fix it. Do not quit. Edit: Holy jeeze. Reading all these comments has been incredible. To the folks out there who took some issue with my assumed optimism, I 1000 understand. This year has brought me to my knees. My father died this year. My dog died. And I work in healthcare. There were weeks this year when I couldnt even get out of bed. Then the anxiety hit and I couldnt sit or sleep or stand or sit or walk. But you know whats bringing me back? Besides my husband and kids? Creating a world I CAN control. Find joy in it if you can. This too shall pass. Thanks for the awards! Now go get your words down.",

I find I write best when I type, because I can keep up with my own thoughts better that way, so some kind of software or app seems like the best choice. Problem is, I'm having trouble finding anything that even comes close to fitting the bill. I'm just looking for four basic things:  MUST be secured. Password protection or encryption or whatever. I need to be able to write honestly without worrying about someone else reading it.  Basic formatting capability.  Ability to backup the entire journal, preferably with password protectionencryption enabled, so that it won't be lost forever in the event of a technical problem.  Ideally, ability to customize the appearance of the journal with themes or something of that sort. This isn't critically important, but I do find it easier to write when tools I'm using are visually pleasing. I've been using a Windows app called Writr, which I liked, but lately it has been glitchy and unreliable. I downloaded FocusWriter, which I also liked, but there doesn't seem to be any way to secure the entries. Any recommendations? I feel like what I'm looking for is fairly simple, yet I can't seem to find anything that incorporates all four requirements.",

      "content": "Hello! A few years back, during a large, large dip in my mental health, I used to keep a journal. The school gave it me and I never brung it home. I struggled alot, I couldn't go into lessons, and my attendance was very poor. The only part of the school I could access was the sensory room, where I kept my journal, and with nobody to talk to, it was the only thing I could vent into. Most of the time, I wrote into it, expressed the words I bottled up, and I felt refreshed almost. As time passed, as my speaking stopped, it was passed onto authorities to have a look at. You could guess what happened, they initially thought I was having nightmares. That's when I thought about giving up on myself before weeks later, the journal changed the eyes of many as I kept using it, and with progress, it helped me move schools. This is why a journal is so important. If you're so lonely, I recommend keeping one as it's like a buddy you can be yourself around. Wishing you luck with your mental health. I know it's hard, but it gets better.",

I purchased 4 journals over 2 years, beautiful journals with quality paper and covers that I loved. Didn't touch them. Until this year. I went through something horrific, and this year I found myself living alone in a place quite far from distractions. I started to journal and my god... Why did I delay. The hardest part was just starting. I was so concerned about what to write, how to write, how pretty the pages looked, how cohesive it would be. Stop. Just write. Write anything. My first entry was just an admission I found it hard to start. Before I knew it, I was 4 pages deep and words were just flowing out without thought. When I finished the entry I read it back and was astounded. I wrote that? It was visceral, honest, reflective. The plug was pulled out and I have not stopped journalling. Not every day, but a few days a week. Sometimes it's just letters to my past self, letters from my future self, goals or a single sentence. Sometimes it's a complete expulsion of trauma I've never said out loud. Sometimes it's very positive, sometimes it's self hating. Sometimes it's poetic and eloquent and I can't even believe I've written it.. I feel the changes. My body is more rested, my mind is quieter. It's done a lot for me, more than any therapy. But combined with therapy and somatic exercises it's changing my brain chemistry profoundly. I can rely on myself more now, to process things, feel safe and talk myself through triggers. Highly recommend!",

Right now, the app is only in Chinese (English support is coming soon). Its available on the Apple App Store (not yet on Google Play). Im inviting 12 people to test it  and when the testing phase is done, Ill give them permanent membership as thanks. Im sharing this because journaling and mood tracking really helped me, and maybe it can help someone else too. If youd like to test, or just share how you track your moods, Id love to hear.",
