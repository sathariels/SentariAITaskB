reddit_post_1eawmn0,reddit,Day One,"7 months ago, my journal got read by my partner. I noticed their replies were off while texting them at work but I wasn't sure what had happened. They asked if there was anything I'd like to tell them, confused, I pressed until they asked if there was anything I'd written in my journal. Whatever I wrote is irrelevant. A journal is meant to be a safe space to process the world around me. Happy, sad, angry, doesn't matter. Process. My partner took that feeling of security from me. I've been journalling for years and I've never felt as insecure as I've felt this year putting my thoughts on paper. Journalling has been the anchor for my functionality; I spiralled this year because for 5 months after my journal was ""raided"", I was unable to journal. I picked up journalling again in May. It's been inconsistent; I've not been able to shake off the feeling of insecurity. To regain that feeling of security, I thought of using a redacting pen this month. I don't have that yet but I want to journal consistently again, and that means feeling safe. I've gone back through my current journal and scribbled out my entries. I scanned my entries before doing that so I could always have some memory of my entries. I hated the scribbling, it goes against what I believe a journal should be, but it's where I'm at. I guess I'm looking for solidarity.

reddit_comment_leoo3t6,reddit,Day One,"I'm so sorry. Having your journal read against your will or knowledge is a betrayal. Especially if it's done by someone you love and who should know better. My parents regularly betrayed my trust that way when I was a teenager. They thought nothing of it. In fact, my father told me to my face just last month that he went through an affirmations journal I'd kept last year because ""it had fallen on the floor and was open"". To put this in context, I'm in my late 20s now. All this time and all those years and they still do not know what they did wrong. I don't know if your partner journals, but my parents dont- so maybe it's a non-journaler thing. They don't know what it means to be vulnerable and so they don't see they're exploiting someone's vulnerability. Or maybe it's a certain type of person thing, because I can't for the life of me understand how someone can't realize it. All this to say- I don't think this is a problem that will go away. Not unless you and your partner are willing to have a very frank discussion about what they did. And not if your partner doesn't respect your boundaries and your privacy. I dealt with it (as a teenager) by crying, yelling, trying to hide my journals which would inevitably be ferreted out by my parents, and then creating a whole new written language system to write in instead when I eventually realized that security was non-existent. I dealt with it last month by walking out of the room midway through my father telling me he'd betrayed my trust yet again. He's not someone you can have open discussions with so there was no point in trying. Physically exiting out of the conversation was an act of self-preservation. I take my journal wherever I go now. And I hide it in better places when I have to leave it behind. It is what it is. The thought of you scribbling out your previous entries hurts my heart.

I wasn't actually trying to improve - I was trying to feel better about not improving. Then I found stoicism through some random YouTube video. Started with Meditations (didn't understand half of it lol). But something clicked. These weren't some 20-year-old tiktokers telling me to ""rise and grind"" - these were emperors and slaves who actually lived this shit. The harsh truth? I wasn't failing because of circumstances. I was failing because: 1. I blamed everything except myself 2. I thought watching motivation videos  taking action 3. I was addicted to comfort while pretending to want growth Real change started when I stopped looking for inspiration and started facing reality. Been diving deeper into stoicism lately (Marcus Aurelius on a Stoic Chat app roasted my victim mentality at 2AM last week lmao). But the biggest shift happened when I finally accepted that:  Motivation is bullshit. You either do it or you don't  Your environment shapes you. I deleted social media, cut toxic friends  Comfort is the enemy. If it doesn't make you uncomfortable, it's not growth  You know what to do.

reddit_post_1k6q4td,reddit,Day One,"So we all know our phones are rotting our brains. Saw this study from Heidelberg University that said your brain can start to rewire itself after just three days of reduced phone usage. Not 21 days. Not 90. Just 3. That number kind of stuck with me. Felt do-able. I didnt delete my apps or anything. Just blocked access to the stuff I usually open on autopilot, Reddit, Insta, news, etc. and only allowed 4 unblocks per day. After 3 days I actually didnt want to go back to my previous baseline. After day 3, I kept going. I was sleeping better. Felt less scatterbrained. I actually reached for a book for the first time in forever. I started doing walks after dinner instead of scrolling. And I noticed this little shift in how present I felt, like I wasnt constantly buzzing in the background. It was like a snowball effect, once I started I kept finding more times in the day I could replace with better things. Heres how I did it:  Used an app blocker so I had to be intentional about when I did use my phone  Kept my phone in another room at night  Picked a couple things to replace the scroll (books, long showers, walks, journaling)  Told myself I only had to make it 3 days That tiny window made it way more approachable.

reddit_post_1ms73k0,reddit,Day One,"For years, I tortured myself with failed habits. Meditation? 3 days and done. Journaling? A notebook with 10 sad pages collecting dust. Cold showers? Painful, but pointless. I thought I was lazy. Turns out, I was just fighting the way my brain works. Heres what finally clicked: 1. Your brain hates habits but loves patterns I used to wait for the perfect reading setup: comfy chair, quiet room, good lighting. That moment never came. So I shifted. Instead of mindlessly watch videos and posts on commutes, lunch breaks, or waiting rooms, I read. Result? 3 books in 3 months. Not record-breaking, but a personal win. 2. Systems  willpower Blank pages killed my journaling attempts. Not knowing where to start  instant shutdown, I felt completely lost. Then I realized: my brain resists decisions, not writing. I researched decision fatigue so I built this daily note structure:  Capture  What caught my attention today?  Connect  Why does it matter? Does it link to a projectgoal?  Next step  Is there an action, or just something worth keeping?  Top 3 Objectives  Task Backlog (auto-shows todays tasks by priority)  Completed Today (auto-log of done tasks)  Reflection  Whats going well? Whats blocking me?  Tomorrows Objectives Thats it. No essays. Just fill in the blanks. Ideas stop floating in sticky notes, apps, and land in one trusted place (for me, its digital, but a notebook works too). Over time, daily notes become a web of insights tied to what I actually care about. 3.Progress  perfection My gym system is stupidly simple: Show up. Stretch if Im not feeling it. Let momentum decide. 80 of the time, I lift. 20 I just walk. Either way  a win When you design around your actual behaviors (instead of copying routines off social media), progress stops feeling like punishment. Habits still matter, but when a system absorbs them and gives them a direction (you build it), they stop being a battle. They just... run in the background. Nonetheless, if you try to to do something that definetely doesn't resonate with you, your goals, values, etc. It doesn't matter if you build the most complex and seamless system, you will still not do it.

reddit_comment_lutqs7t,reddit,Day One,"Tl;dr: Inkodo is probably your best bet. Mark up apps on Windows for note-taking isn't great. I'm not sure if you're still looking for a solution, but to be honest, Inkodo is the best solution I've found for handwriting notes (and I have similar requirements as you). For reference, I'm currently using a non-graphic drawing tablet (I've shifted over from a touch screen windows 2-1 laptop with pen support). I've tried countless apps (Inkodo, Obsidian, OneNote, Drawboard, Goodnotes, Xournal, Xournal, Bamboo Paper, Xodo, Edge, Nebo, Microsoft Journal, Scrbl Ink, and MANY others I can't even remember) on my previous laptop and a couple on this drawing pad. Drawboard and Goodnotes were great for me years ago before they started limiting basic features behind paywalls, became bug ridden, slow, and subscription based. OneNote has the best pen support by far and it's not even a competition, but the lack of features, bugs, failing to sync occasionally (safer to use offline imo), among other things made it a no go for me. In the end, I went with Inkodo because it best suit my needs (no infinite scroll, PDF support, organized, no major bugs, decent customizability and tools). It's not a perfect app but it's the ""best"" app out of the bunch for me. The runner-ups I remember that are worth checking out are XournalXournal and Scrbl Ink (lite version). Bamboo Paper was insanely fast iirc compared to a lot of the other apps, but I found the app a little too basic for my liking and it didn't support importing PDFs when I tested it.",Comment on: Notetaking apps for Windows with a similar noteboo...,3,Disposable-Dingus,Disposable-Dingus,False,2024-11-01T04:02:05,2025-09-06T17:43:23.313196,,1,1,,,,,,https://reddit.com/r/software/comments/16gusn9/notetaking_apps_for_windows_with_a_similar/lutqs7t/,,unclassified,"{""ux_ui"": 0.0, ""pricing"": 0.0528169014084507, ""performance"": 0.1584507042253521, ""features"": 0.0, ""customer_service"": 0.2112676056338028, ""content_quality"": 0.0}",0.2640845070422535,positive,0.584192439862543,"[""support"", ""subscription"", ""fast"", ""slow"", ""bug""]",False,False,0.0,"{""subreddit"": ""software"", ""parent_post_id"": ""16gusn9"", ""sentiment_score"": 0.15151515151515152, ""post_type"": ""comment""}"

Its majority journal  habit tracker app combined with a mood diary. Play Store Link( Features  Benefits Journaling Track whatever action or event in your day. Like simple yes or no answers to stats like reddit usage or tea intake. A key benefit is the simplicity I have developed after 2 years of my own usage, which until recently I am finally happy with. A good case study is a reddit post showing 200 actions that I recorded daily in a year: Post in question( (A lot of people wonder but the time using the app is less than 5 mins daily.) Mood diary Instead of having 20 words to define your happiness. I split happiness into 3 pillars:  Mental well-being  Physical well-being  Social well-being Being wider reaching, even if you feel happy emotionally, there is nuance in knowing if that coincided with beneficialnegative physical or social feelings. Others  CSV, JSON export at any time  Reminders on a weekly, monthly or custom timeframe  Lots of stats and charts  On device machine learning (not a chat-gpt wrapper), calculates from every journal and mood entry the impact of your actions on your life  lots more Play Store Link( Website( Pricing Freemium - Full access with ads Similar to the Spotify model, one rewarded ad covers one day of usage. I am not interested in creating artificial barriers of access, the ads simply cover any costs for usage so everyone gets worry free storage and syncing.

Update Plan  Playground screen - customisable charts or models to find relationships in your life.  Multiple reminders - some way for each action to have more than one reminder.  Less show and more tell - want to explain charts and stats instead of simply dumping them on a screen  Swap between NightLight theme. The app already follows the device theme but doing this in app would be useful. This is my first serious project with a worldwide audience with just as much variety in devices and OS.

It comes from within, if someone is stuck in their journaling routine. Or if someone is not doing it often doe to any reason what so ever, AI has no place in driving or motivating a person. Because, that totally defeats the purpose of putting your personal thoughts, your brainstorming, your plans on to an external medium. Its intimate and its personal. Only through personal introspective can a journal entry be truly be meaningful, otherwise its coerced, and this just so wrong. Not everything needs to have AI.

reddit_post_1lrfu9y,reddit,Day One,"(reposted from rtechsupport) Good morning everyone! I don't use Reddit that often, but this time I desperately need help. I have had a diary app called Universum since 2018. My daily diaries are something I hold really close to my heart, so I had invested on a Premium account on the app, which allowed me to access its cloud. This meant that even when I changed my phone, I could easily download the app on another phone, enter my account with a mail, and have access all of my previous diaries. This time around, however, I couldn't do this. After breaking my old phone and buying a new one, I couldn't find Universum on the new one's Play Store. I have tried on different phones too, but no such luck. The app has disappeared from everywhere. I have contacted the ""developers"" through an email I found on a poorly designed website online, but they didn't respond. I have also tried downloading the APK file from different websites, but despite logging into my account, my old diaries weren't there. Luckily, I had downloaded PDFs of my diaries from the previous years, but I'm missing ones from this year and the end of last year. If anyone still has Universum downloaded on their phone, I am willing to give you access to my account just to restore these diaries. Any other suggestion on what I should do (or what precautions I should take to share my account info safely) is welcome. Thank you!

reddit_post_1n9vnc1,reddit,Day One,"TL;DR: Solo dev (cognitive science  data  Flutter) built two Polish mental-healthskills apps: a free-for-schools student version and a public edition (30 free, simple monthly sub). Clinically grounded content, APA references, real tools, not fluff. Looking for feedback and early users. Hi! I built two mobile apps completely solo, after hours, with no funding and Id never shipped a mobile app before. Short backstory: Im a cognitive science grad who drifted into tech and mostly worked with data. It wasnt quite the right fit for me, so I decided to build something closer to my core interestsand actually useful. I learned Flutter in a few days and started building. I ended up with two apps:  Velora Student: for Polish high schools (access-code only).  Velora (public edition): a separate version with slightly different content and features. Why two? I want schools to get Velora for free. The public version is meant to cover the costs. Pricing is simple: 30 of content is free, the rest is a monthly subscription. No dark patterns, no tricks. Status: both apps are live on Android and iOS, Polish-only for now. Im not doing auto-translationsthis is personal, and Im careful about content quality. Every section and exercise is backed by clinical literature, with an in-app Scientific basis area (APA-style references, PubMed links, etc.). # Whats inside (public edition)  Clinical psychological questionnaires with clear, high-quality result visualizations.  Self-help programs across multiple therapeutic models.  Therapeutic exercises only from officialvalidated methods (no made-up stuff).  Weekly check-ins across 9 bio-psycho-social areas.  Weekly challenges generated from program content.  CBT journals, e.g., an automatic thoughts journal.  Dashboards summarizing your check-ins over time.  Verified database of free support in Poland (free hotlines, crisis centers), filterable by voivodeship.  Daily side quests (a small card draw with simple, helpful tasks). # Extra for schools (Velora Student  counselor layer)  Anonymous chat with the school psychologist.  Psychologist dashboard to streamline work.  Send test results to the school psychologist.  Book appointments with the school psychologist.  Incident reporting and crisis messages.  Aggregated results and well-being reports for schools. What I need: Id love feedback. Id love users. I cant run ads coz Im broke. My hope is to keep the school edition free and fund it with the public app. If youre in Poland and you try it even one install helps. If you work in a school (psychologist, teacher, admin) and want to pilot it, lets talk. The screenshots youll see are from the current build. The apps still need work, and Ill keep pushing until theyre the best in their category.

Map-first approach - location is the main navigation, not date folders  30-character limit on notes (forces you to capture the essence, not write essays)  Creates shareable journey pages that work like mini travel guides Built this because I'm convinced that location  time  moment  perfect travel memory, and most apps only handle one of these well.

reddit_post_1jv3war,reddit,Day One,"Two years ago, I took a creative writing class at the local community college. Just for fun. I have a full-time job, and I'm a single dad, but I've always thought about writing, because I love to read and I have crazy ideas. The final assignment of the course was the first chapter of the novel idea that we had come up with. On the final day of class we were grouped in pairs of three to four students. The instructions were to read the other chapters and provide light, positive feedback. The other students work was different from mine - I was aiming for a middle grade book, they were writing adult fiction, but it was interesting to read their ideas and see their characters. The feedback I received was not light or positive though. The other students slammed my work. They said my supporting character was cold and unbelievable. They said my plot wasn't interesting. That my writing was repetitive. I asked them if they had anything positive to add and they shrugged.The professor also read the chapter and provided some brief feedback, it was mostly constructive. Nothing harsh, but it wasn't enough to overcome the other feedback. There was a nice, ""keep writing!"" note at the top of my chapter. I put it away. For two years now. I lurk on this sub, but I haven't written in the past two years. I journal and brainstorm. But I don't write. Because two people in my writing class couldn't find anything nice to say about the chapter I wrote. But fuck 'em. Which is what I should have said two years ago. If I can't take criticism, I shouldn't plan on writing anything. And I'm not going to get better if I stop anyways. So I decided to pick it back up, and I'll keep trying.

Thing is, at least early on, I want my protagonist to see him that way, but not necessarily my readers.

Do you think short journal entries written from his perspective (although not necessarily outright telling the audience that its him, just letting them figure it out) could be a good way to help them get to know him, or is that just a lazy cop-out technique when I should be able to make his more likeable qualities come through without delving into his pov at all?

Look up Journaling and you will see tons of things that people do with their little books today. Writing for yourself in these ways can make you a better writer, and can help with mental health too.

reddit_post_1gb4qmy,reddit,Day One,"Okay, so about half a year ago, I figured I wanted to be a writer after I came up with a brilliant idea for a book (for context, I'm 14), and I always loved reading. I've been developing this idea, brainstorming about all the different characters and scenes I wanted to have. I started writing at the end of July. About once a week, I sat down, and wrote, for just a 10 minutes or so. But recently, I realised I was pretty lazy with my work. I either had to do stuff for my school, or was on my phone (which I realised was a bad habit). So instead of playing games, I at least watched some youtube videos with advice for young writers or writers in general. And many of them said, that perhaps I should not start with my best idea. This had me thinking. The problem was, I was not only working on my best idea, but it was my ONLY idea. So I basically had no other choice, unless you count fanfiction. I thought about that for a while too, but decided it wasn't such a good idea (for me, personally). So now I came up with an idea. Maybe, the best to do is starting a diary, writing about my past and present. It is a bit different, because unlike with my idea for a book, I wouldn't like anyone to read THAT, so it wouldn't need to be even close to perfect. It would make me practicing. Also, I would never get stuck, because it's my past. But I'm still not so sure. Is this actually a good idea? I haven't seen it in any of the videos I watched, I came up with it all on my own.

reddit_comment_ltjhvjw,reddit,Day One,"That is stupid advice you got from Youtube. Go ahead and write what you think your best idea is. A diary is a good idea too. The key things at this point are to write a lot and read a lot with intention. What do I mean? When you notice something that works well in a bookstory, think about why it works, and journal at least part of the time about that. Figuring out what other writers do that works (or doesn't) is a key in honing your own abilities. I'm not saying you copy them; you are adding tools to your toolkit. As far as writing, you need to do it regularly. A lot of people will say write X words per day. You don't have to follow that advice. But you should try to write most days. Even when I am otherwise busy (I work 80hr a week in summer), I try to get down 100 words or more per day, which is not a lot. 500 is more aggressive but still very manageable (this is not quite two double-spaced word processor pages). Don't worry about blowing your first idea. Writing is one of those things you need to put in time and effort into learning, so your first bookstorywhatever is probably not going to be very good. Nobody's is. But here's the thing: ideas tend to be the easiest part. I have thousands of good ideas. I get new ones every day.

That isnt to say it isnt a good writing method. I think its a bit silly to say an aspiring writer shouldnt write their first idea; we all start somewhere. A diary of your life is a good way to get in tune with yourself, and figure out what aspects of your life impact the story youre sitting on, but will you stick to it? Will you dedicate time each day to writing in it? Or would it be a waste of money on a notebook you end up keeping stashed somewhere for no one to read? If you have a story to write, begin writing it. You can trim it and add to it as time goes on. People have been published at ages as young as 12 and 13; dont let your age be something that holds you back from pursuing your writing. Begin with character development on paper or computer; shift to world building, and then make a rough draft. Youre more than capable of writing the story youve come up withyou thought of it, for Heavens sake!

I take notes when I do research and I'm trying to get everything together. My writing and structure have picked up and I think I'm taking feedback well.  I think its slowed my writing pace, but I think for the better. As I was going, with the feedback I've received my story turned out to be pretty weak as I've portrayed it. Better to sort these things out now than to trudge or blaze through a whole piece and have that much more work to do after. The way I see it, the random scenes and character interactions that pop into my head and I jot down to later incorporate are organic. This entire world is already in my head. I just need to get it on paper, whether by prose or notes, and analyze it. I am coming to a point where I'm organizing my feedback to implement it, with my notes, and just engage in some pure writing. So that's my experience. Not journaling, but outling and notes.

I struggled alot, I couldn't go into lessons, and my attendance was very poor. The only part of the school I could access was the sensory room, where I kept my journal, and with nobody to talk to, it was the only thing I could vent into. Most of the time, I wrote into it, expressed the words I bottled up, and I felt refreshed almost. As time passed, as my speaking stopped, it was passed onto authorities to have a look at. You could guess what happened, they initially thought I was having nightmares. That's when I thought about giving up on myself before weeks later, the journal changed the eyes of many as I kept using it, and with progress, it helped me move schools.

I purchased 4 journals over 2 years, beautiful journals with quality paper and covers that I loved. Didn't touch them. Until this year. I went through something horrific, and this year I found myself living alone in a place quite far from distractions. I started to journal and my god... Why did I delay. The hardest part was just starting. I was so concerned about what to write, how to write, how pretty the pages looked, how cohesive it would be. Stop. Just write. Write anything. My first entry was just an admission I found it hard to start. Before I knew it, I was 4 pages deep and words were just flowing out without thought. When I finished the entry I read it back and was astounded. I wrote that? It was visceral, honest, reflective. The plug was pulled out and I have not stopped journalling. Not every day, but a few days a week. Sometimes it's just letters to my past self, letters from my future self, goals or a single sentence. Sometimes it's a complete expulsion of trauma I've never said out loud. Sometimes it's very positive, sometimes it's self hating.
