I hate subscriptions but is 3 bucks enough to net you a lifetime of support? - Most photo formats dont actually display a thumbnail, for example HEIF from your iPhone doesnt display. All that said it does have one of the best file attachment systems that I wish other journal apps would emulate. Keeping an eye on this one!",

      "content": "Hey it is my first post here. I just want to share my story. i hope you will like and you can get inspiration from my life  I started Android development at the beginning of high school. But I bought my first laptop in university.  Yep, you read that right. Because my first code editor was my phone. Back then, there was an app on Android called Sketchware. I spent a long time building projects on it. But it was so limited. you couldnt fully develop professional projects, writing native modules was almost impossible. Then Sketchware got removed from the play store, became open source, and other developers improved it. I jumped back in, made some small projects. but nothing big ever got finished. Between preparing for university exams and Google dropping APK support in favor of AAB, my motivation took a hit, and I quit development for a while. I got into Computer Engineering (my life dream) but still no laptop. For the next 6 months, I survived on lab computers, mostly doing HTMLCSS websites instead of Android. When I finally bought my laptop, the very first thing I installed wasnt VS Code. it was Android Studio. But Id forgotten Java, and I didnt know any modern frameworks. Honestly, I never have good knowledgement about Java. Then I learned some JavaScript libraries for web development. I discovered React, and suddenly everything felt easier. That led me to learning React Native, and the idea of cross platform development blew my mind (even though Im not much of an iOS fan). I joined competitions, even got some good rankings. Tried a startup in agriculture tech. didnt work out. I published My Website. Went on Erasmus to Poland (country of Zabbka ). Had an amazing time there, but more importantly, And in Erasmus i was have a project idea: a book reader app. By then, I had also improved my UI design skills. I followed designers on Twitter and Dribbble, so creating the design was easy. I started coding, thinking itd take 1 month. It took 2.5 months. I ran into unexpected problems (React Native EPUB support is terrible, PDFs arent great either). But I finished it. I paid 25 for a Google Play developer account. Uploaded the app... and Google told me I needed 12 testers. For 14 days I begged friends, family, anyone I could find. Got rejected. Tried again. Another 14 days. And finally... Google approved it.  Screenshots, descriptions, and my App Leckham is live. if you want to check the app:  After 8 years, I made my dream come true. I wanted to share this because maybe youre reading this with low motivation, maybe it is not true time but trust me, if you keep going, one day it will happen. Have a good day . Eren. and this image is screenshot from play console, if you want to check and giving advice to me",

My reddit usage definitely went overboard last night   Sorry for the S23 and Z Fold 5 users that had their phones crash. :( What is Habitually( A Frankenstein accounting tool for your life. Its majority journal  habit tracker app combined with a mood diary. Play Store Link( Features  Benefits Journaling Track whatever action or event in your day. Like simple yes or no answers to stats like reddit usage or tea intake. A key benefit is the simplicity I have developed after 2 years of my own usage, which until recently I am finally happy with. A good case study is a reddit post showing 200 actions that I recorded daily in a year: Post in question( (A lot of people wonder but the time using the app is less than 5 mins daily.) Mood diary Instead of having 20 words to define your happiness. I split happiness into 3 pillars:  Mental well-being  Physical well-being  Social well-being Being wider reaching, even if you feel happy emotionally, there is nuance in knowing if that coincided with beneficialnegative physical or social feelings. Others  CSV, JSON export at any time  Reminders on a weekly, monthly or custom timeframe  Lots of stats and charts  On device machine learning (not a chat-gpt wrapper), calculates from every journal and mood entry the impact of your actions on your life  lots more Play Store Link( Website( Pricing Freemium - Full access with ads Similar to the Spotify model, one rewarded ad covers one day of usage. I am not interested in creating artificial barriers of access, the ads simply cover any costs for usage so everyone gets worry free storage and syncing. Month 0.79 (9.48yr) Year 9.49 (0.79mo) Lifetime 14.99 or 11.99 if bought within 2 weeks of creating an account. For fun and a laugh, the same rewarded ad you can watch in the settings screen extends the month and year subscription by a day. Stats and how its going after a year From incompetence and a hatred of marketing: 500 downloads - Most from a single post I made in April. 40 DAU (fluctuates - 10) 6 retention for long term use is kinda cool. Update Plan  Playground screen - customisable charts or models to find relationships in your life.  Multiple reminders - some way for each action to have more than one reminder.  Less show and more tell - want to explain charts and stats instead of simply dumping them on a screen  Swap between NightLight theme. The app already follows the device theme but doing this in app would be useful. This is my first serious project with a worldwide audience with just as much variety in devices and OS. So making Habitually work for anyone anywhere is a huge priority. If you want, how you can help Being obsessed with Habitually I naturally have blind spots. Additionally, everyone is not me and have their own tastesideas so go nuts with the feedback or ideas. Where you can reach me:  Email:   Message me here on reddit or comment on this post if it will publicly benefit people PROMO CODES The lifetime codes given are permanent unless you delete the associated account. They are redeemed in-app - settings screen - promo code section (close to the bottom of the screen) I'll check for blatantly obvious bot accounts before sending them via dms. Edit 1: Progress: 80 of the way. Sorry for taking so long. Especially sorry for a Samsung S23 user who had a crash. Will work to be better :( Edit 2: Progress Last 10 to go. Sorry for anyone kept waiting, I'm about to call it for the night. Somehow Samsung are struggling as a Z Fold 5 has crashed too. Which I will look into as my brother has that phone. I use a S20 Ultra, own a S8 and S10, so these crashes are of my own fault and not a weird Android Behaviour. Luckily that also means there is a fix that won't be too hard. Edit 3: And all the codes are done. We can take this off reddit now. So any feedback or ideas emailed to me at:  will be rewarded with a Lifetime Subscription",

Im in my 40s now and have never been married but I used to be in relationship after relationship and I would lose myself in that. Now that Ive dedicated myself to reading more, learning more about my emotions, becoming the best version of myself I have become very lonely. How do you guys deal with it? Im aware what Im asking for isnt a fixed solution but this has to get better over time right? EDIT: Thanks to all who commented. I didn't really expect this many people to have a take but I appreciate it. After I posted last night I actually went out to meet up with a friend and had a really good conversation. I think that what I'm doing and this feeling of loneliness is definitely normal and I have been better reaching out to friends when I need them which I wasn't very good at in the past. I'm going to try to respond to as many comments as possible. Thank you. 3",

You can keep giving it and it doesnt cost you anything. 2. You can only be offended if you let yourself be offended. 3. When someone is drowning, dont tell them they should have taken swimming lessons. Help first. Educate second. 4. Your struggles today will be your accomplishments tomorrow. Keep going. 5. Building resilience isnt something that comes and goes with your mood. Resilience is your intention and becomes a part of you. When that happens, nothing can stop you. 6. At 23 I worried what people thought of me. At 43 I realized they werent even thinking about me. At 73 I really dont care that much about what people do think of me. Adopt that one early. 7. Books are like the years in your life. It's not how many you have, its how good they are. 8. With hope you can endure and accomplish anything. 9. What you think of me is none of my business. 10. Nobody gets to their deathbed upset they tried too many things. But plenty of people get there with regrets for the things they didnt try. 11. You can only be in a bad mood if you let yourself. 12. Being grateful is a cheat sheet for happiness. 13. The pain you feel today is the strength youll feel tomorrow. Keep pushing forward. 14. Never say anything to yourself that you wouldnt say to a loved one. 15. We make the best decisions we can, with the information we have at that time. Give yourself a break. 16. Say something. Do something. Be something. 17. Believe in yourself. Dont listen to the critics. Theyre either envious or they cant do it themselves. 18. Your age is up to you. Im 73 but I believe and act like Im 19. Find your happy age. Its more important than the years. 19. Action is the medicine for Fear of Failure. Just start moving. 20. Lead with your heart but manage with your head. I absolutely made that mistake. More than once. 21. You will never go wrong being too kind to someone. Sometimes it will feel like they are taking advantage of you. But thats on them, not you. 22. You can tell the strength of a relationship by the number of calluses on the upper lip from biting it. 23. Dont stay stuck on every idea. Trees bend for a reason. 24. To become successful, be useful. Be useful to enough people and success will find you. 25. Life doesnt come with an unlimited number of chances. Dont hesitate. 26. Forgetting something is the universes way of telling you to be more present. 27. If you dont expect anything, youll never be disappointed. 28. Im not anti-social. Im just not very pro-social. 29. So little time. So many books. 30. Everyone has their first day on the job. Give them a break. 31. Money is important to have (and usually necessary), until your happiness becomes more important. 32. It isnt over until YOU say its over. 33. My best tip and hope for us: Live and let live. If you're lucky enough to get up to my age, the view becomes clearer. Sometimes youll be up and sometimes youll be down. But nothing ever stays the same. And that's ok. Enjoy the ride. Onward! Louie Please add something you know to be true, in the comments. We learn together.",

I trauma dumped a little and said I've been through multiple traumatic things and protected my sanity through dissociating for a couple decades and it wasn't until recently i decided to wake up. but hear me out guys if you are struggling with loneliness, I got to where I was at before I met her.

Nothing about my life would have changed if I got laid and getting laid doesn't change anything either besides being able to use the virgin insult now in online gaming officially. you can look at my journey on my profile regarding my other posts to see how i progressed mentally. not that any of this matters, i just want to feel special for a moment.",

What surprised me was how many recurring themes emerged. I complain about the same situations repeatedly but never take action to change them. I also discovered I'm much more affected by sleep and diet than I realized. Bad days almost always correlate with poor sleep or junky meals. Seeing these patterns written out made them impossible to ignore. Now I'm actually addressing root causes instead of just reacting to symptoms. Simple but powerful tool.",

AND it lets me see from the very beginning how ive changed in emotions, mental states, and skill. its helped a lot and i find it a lot of fun! it can literally be about ANYTHING, you just have to write! i started reading this post and went i should start a journal theyre right... wait a minute.

This piece, Elevate, is me putting those thoughts into words, about growth, challenges, and the decision to step into my own power before hitting the next decade. # Elevate Who wouldve thought Id be sitting on the edge of 30, same old baggage being carried up the same old staircase. I did. My third eye has shown me my future more times than I can remember, pointing out those same old flaws begging me to get rid. I was waiting patiently for the Lord to give me the answers, until I ran out of patience to give. No one told me I was supposed to go and find the answers, that arrogance has been expensive. You dont know the things I've almost lost from losing myself, or maybe you do. Maybe theres other people out there only caked in failure, and they know what I've been through. But that companionship is empty because wrong is still wrong, and Id rather be lonely than fit in somewhere I dont belong. Maybe your mistakes define you, but I wasnt sent here for mediocrity. My mistakes have been lessons, and I've been skipping class for too long. 29-30 is 365 days to become dangerous, find MY north star, and elevate. Stars are out of reach only for those who impose things on themselves that keep them grounded. But me? I elevate. Some will join me. Some might fall short. Many will try to tear me down, and yet still, I elevate. I rise. I break. I shift. I elevate. And when all is said and done, the ghost that once haunted me will give me the nod of approval because my third eye is still showing me my future. Its seen the shift, changed the trajectories, because truly, this is the season, that I elevate.",

I'm considering Kishōtenketsu as an alternative, non-linear storytelling (aka. tasteful randomness) and modular narratives, but I'm wondering of there are other narrative structures or even formulas that work well enough but aren't overused.

A child leaves home, faces hardships, at first with the help of an older person, but then on their own, grows up and finds their own identity, thenexperience returns home an adult, or finds a new home as part of a family of their own making. It'a a universal experinence that almost every human being goes through, so it's a safe bet that it will resonate with the audience. The concept \"the hero's journey\" isn't Campbell's, it was coined by Hollywood executive Christopher Vogler, and it makes much more sense as a screenwriting tool based on Campbell's work, rather than a universal structure that permeates everything. Campbell never said the monomyth was universal, just a recurring pattern. Vogler wanted every movie to follow the hero's journey becasue it's a safe bet at the box office. If you want a story other than the hero's journey, pick some other human experience than \"child becomes adult\" and you'll have yourself a different structure. \"Die Hard,\" for example, is not structured around the hero's journey. John McClane is already awesome at fighting robbers, but he's not a good husband, and he needs to open up emotionally to be able to salvage his marriage, which is what the story is really about. It's a romance. Detective stories aren't hero's journey's either. Sherlock Holmes doesn't grow, he uncovers mysteries.",

The Heros Journey is just a normal cadence that most stories tend to follow. And just because a story follows this pattern doesnt mean its formulaic. The content of the story is what makes it different from the others. So personally, I am not too concerned if my stories somehow work into a Heros Journey structure, hopefully the story contents are original enough and not too similar to something else.",

The writing obviously doesnt have to be worthy of publication, or even half decent! A stream of consciousness is okay. Stuff only understandable to you is okay. Anything more than a blank page is okay. Dont set a word quota, just pour your heart out and watch the words flow with surprising ease. Do it. This is your sign.",

I have a full-time job, and I'm a single dad, but I've always thought about writing, because I love to read and I have crazy ideas. The final assignment of the course was the first chapter of the novel idea that we had come up with. On the final day of class we were grouped in pairs of three to four students. The instructions were to read the other chapters and provide light, positive feedback. The other students work was different from mine - I was aiming for a middle grade book, they were writing adult fiction, but it was interesting to read their ideas and see their characters. The feedback I received was not light or positive though. The other students slammed my work. They said my supporting character was cold and unbelievable. They said my plot wasn't interesting. That my writing was repetitive. I asked them if they had anything positive to add and they shrugged.The professor also read the chapter and provided some brief feedback, it was mostly constructive. Nothing harsh, but it wasn't enough to overcome the other feedback. There was a nice, \"keep writing!\" note at the top of my chapter. I put it away. For two years now. I lurk on this sub, but I haven't written in the past two years. I journal and brainstorm. But I don't write. Because two people in my writing class couldn't find anything nice to say about the chapter I wrote. But fuck 'em. Which is what I should have said two years ago. If I can't take criticism, I shouldn't plan on writing anything. And I'm not going to get better if I stop anyways. So I decided to pick it back up, and I'll keep trying. Even if my characters are cold and unbelievable. Even if my plot isn't interesting. So here we are.",

Thing is, at least early on, I want my protagonist to see him that way, but not necessarily my readers. I dont want him to be a full-on pov character, but I have considered the idea of starting or ending chapters with journal entries from his pov, to give a bit more of a window into his mind. I know that having him be flawed early on provides ample opportunity for character development, but I dont want readers to give up on him before he starts to open up. Do you think short journal entries written from his perspective (although not necessarily outright telling the audience that its him, just letting them figure it out) could be a good way to help them get to know him, or is that just a lazy cop-out technique when I should be able to make his more likeable qualities come through without delving into his pov at all? Thanks for any advice or suggestions you can offer; please be kind .",

They were very brief journal entries. Generally I think there are probably more effective ways to characterize your deuteragonist, but maybe thats just my personal preference. If youre going to do the journal thing, the main thing for me to not be annoyed by it is make sure the character writing the entries is one I am invested in and intrigued by. Obviously easier said than done, but point being that journal entries are annoying for characters I dont care about, and toleratedenjoyable for characters I do care about.

I think of a diary at one side of a spectrum as more as a record of events and impressions that happened that day, where I think of a journal at the other end as more ideas, notes, drawings. You might check out some famous diaries like that of Samuel Pepys or Virginia Woolf, the journals of Lewis and Clark. Look up Journaling and you will see tons of things that people do with their little books today. Writing for yourself in these ways can make you a better writer, and can help with mental health too. Explore. Don't think that there is a right way. And most importantly remember that it isn't a competition. There are lots of well written diaries and beautiful journals, and that is great. But I will tell you mine over the years have been much more a mishmash of notes, some diary like entries, the occasional act of drawing which only I can probably identify what I drew (hopefully!). scribbles galore.

Either way, the idea is to develop at least some level of a \"stream of consciousness\" into what you are writing. You're more likely to add believable psychology to your voice doing that than working on endless outlining and mulling over genre and \"who your audience is\". Journal away, you may find a gem hidden somewhere.",

      "content": "Okay, so about half a year ago, I figured I wanted to be a writer after I came up with a brilliant idea for a book (for context, I'm 14), and I always loved reading. I've been developing this idea, brainstorming about all the different characters and scenes I wanted to have. I started writing at the end of July. About once a week, I sat down, and wrote, for just a 10 minutes or so. But recently, I realised I was pretty lazy with my work. I either had to do stuff for my school, or was on my phone (which I realised was a bad habit). So instead of playing games, I at least watched some youtube videos with advice for young writers or writers in general. And many of them said, that perhaps I should not start with my best idea. This had me thinking. The problem was, I was not only working on my best idea, but it was my ONLY idea. So I basically had no other choice, unless you count fanfiction. I thought about that for a while too, but decided it wasn't such a good idea (for me, personally). So now I came up with an idea. Maybe, the best to do is starting a diary, writing about my past and present. It is a bit different, because unlike with my idea for a book, I wouldn't like anyone to read THAT, so it wouldn't need to be even close to perfect. It would make me practicing. Also, I would never get stuck, because it's my past. But I'm still not so sure. Is this actually a good idea? I haven't seen it in any of the videos I watched, I came up with it all on my own. So what is a better thing to do than ask some of you?",

The key things at this point are to write a lot and read a lot with intention. What do I mean? When you notice something that works well in a bookstory, think about why it works, and journal at least part of the time about that. Figuring out what other writers do that works (or doesn't) is a key in honing your own abilities. I'm not saying you copy them; you are adding tools to your toolkit. As far as writing, you need to do it regularly. A lot of people will say write X words per day. You don't have to follow that advice. But you should try to write most days. Even when I am otherwise busy (I work 80hr a week in summer), I try to get down 100 words or more per day, which is not a lot. 500 is more aggressive but still very manageable (this is not quite two double-spaced word processor pages). Don't worry about blowing your first idea. Writing is one of those things you need to put in time and effort into learning, so your first bookstorywhatever is probably not going to be very good. Nobody's is. But here's the thing: ideas tend to be the easiest part. I have thousands of good ideas. I get new ones every day. A LOT of unfinished books out there are the author's first good idea that they keep grinding on and grinding on forever (usually the first few chapters, not even the whole thing) because it isn't \"perfect,\" when no book ever is.",

A diary is another optionbut take it from someone who wrote a short horror story at 12 with a friend by hand: writing everything with pen and paper can be tedious. That isnt to say it isnt a good writing method. I think its a bit silly to say an aspiring writer shouldnt write their first idea; we all start somewhere. A diary of your life is a good way to get in tune with yourself, and figure out what aspects of your life impact the story youre sitting on, but will you stick to it? Will you dedicate time each day to writing in it? Or would it be a waste of money on a notebook you end up keeping stashed somewhere for no one to read? If you have a story to write, begin writing it. You can trim it and add to it as time goes on. People have been published at ages as young as 12 and 13; dont let your age be something that holds you back from pursuing your writing. Begin with character development on paper or computer; shift to world building, and then make a rough draft. Youre more than capable of writing the story youve come up withyou thought of it, for Heavens sake! Dont let YouTube influence you too heavily, those creators dont know what youve concocted in your brain. Theyre giving general advice.",

      "content": "My problem is that I feel as if this trope is a little boring, as I dont want the main character to so readily become a good guy against after suddenly gaining his memories back. I think you may have answered your own question: If you think it's boring for the character to snap back readily to a good guy by getting his memories back, then do something different to that. Maybe the character doesn't get their memories back - he has these people telling him who he used to be, and he believes them but he doesn't feel it. Maybe the character gets his original memories back but keeps the new ones as well and is torn between them. Depending on how he got his original memories restored, does he even trust them? Maybe getting the memories back isn't \"readily\" but a slow, arduous process he has to work through, which is painful for both him and those who care about him. Maybe something else. What spin on the idea do you think would bring out the best version of your story?",

Even today they take me back. I'm sorry, I just can't choose one song. I was a Metal fan and big into Rush, Van Halen, Judas Priest, and Iron Maiden back then, but Journey was also a favorite of mine.",

The front cover looks like an actual front cover of a journal. If the app has a lock on the front cover that unlocks when you type in your password, that would be cool. The same goes for choosing different fonts and changing the font size, adding pictures... If anyone knows one (if anything like that even exists) please share links or recommendations.

The idea is to use existing tools to just start writing, and have the records automatically arranged in a specified folder.

I haven't yet tested this on mac and other Unix systems, so it would be great to get some feedback on those platforms as well. Thanks",

I stayed physically active, working out and running regularly, but when it came to tasks that required focus or finishing extra responsibilities, everything took me much longer to complete.

No theoretical fluff  just real, tested methods from someone who's been in the trenches. Let me be real with you: implementing these changes wasn't smooth sailing. There were days I fell back into old patterns, moments of frustration, and times I questioned if it was worth it. But looking back now, these strategies fundamentally changed how I approach life and productivity. Here's what actually worked for me:  Morning Sanctuary: I replaced the instant phone grab with 30 minutes of peace. Just water, window gazing, and letting my mind settle. The first week was torture  my hand would literally twitch toward my phone. Now? It's the most peaceful part of my day. The urge to check notifications eventually fades, I promise.  Movement Medicine: Skip the intense workout pressure. I discovered that simple movement  like walking without podcasts or dancing badly while making breakfast  gives me a more sustainable dopamine boost than endless doomless scrolling ever did. Your body literally rewards you for basic movement, no gym membership required.  Real Connection Reset: Having coffee with friends, phones face-down, felt weirdly uncomfortable at first. Those silent moments where we'd usually hide in our screens? They turned into the deepest conversations I've had in years. The human connection hits different when you're fully present.  Analog Joy: Found myself picking up origami (of all things). There's something deeply satisfying about creating something physical with your hands. Whether it's drawing, writing in a journal, or building something  tangible activities give you that dopamine hit without the digital drain.  Single-Task Revolution: Turns out, my brain wasn't designed for constant task-switching. When I work, I just work. When I rest, I actually rest (revolutionary, I know). It felt impossible at first, but like training a puppy, my mind gradually learned to stay focused.  Evening Rituals: Created a proper shutdown sequence for my day instead of streaming until my eyes blur. Sometimes it's reading an actual book, sometimes just sitting with my thoughts. My sleep quality skyrocketed, and morning-me is way less grumpy. Here's the real talk: this isn't about becoming some digital monk or never enjoying Netflix again. I still use technology, but now I'm in control, not the other way around. Some days are better than others, and that's completely okay. Remember, these changes took months, not days. Start small, be patient with yourself, and know that every tiny victory counts. Drop a comment about which strategy you're going to try first  let's keep supporting each other on this journey. Edit: Since some of you asked  yes, this is all from personal experience. The struggles, the setbacks, and the small wins are all real. Thanks for creating this space where we can have honest conversations about something we all face.",

You're better off having a goal that you enjoy the process of working towards than to have no goal at all. Hitting the goal is a bonus, but does not dictate the value you get from the journey.",

Nothing works in the long run. But about 2 months ago, I started doing somthing that actually changed things for me. I began keeping a \"procrastination journal\" (sounds stupid, I know, but hear me out). Every time I caught myself procrastinating, I'd quickly jot down:  What I was supposed to be doing  What I was doing instead (usually scrolling Reddit or watching yt shorts)  How I was feeling in that moment And then I would read it at the end of the day. At first, it felt pointless. But after a few weeks, I started noticing patterns. Turns out, I wasn't just being \"lazy\" - I was avoiding specific types of tasks when I felt overwhelmed or unsure where to start. I am a software dev who also do the product management at my company. And I hate doing \"research\" on features. The weird thing is, just being aware of these patterns made them easier to deal with. When I know that if i had to do research, greater changes i won't be productive today. And now Instead of beating myself up, I started break down the scary tasks into smaller chunks. I'm not saying I'm some productivity guru now and I still waste time watching stupid yt videos when I should be working. But holy shit, the difference is night and day. Projects that used to take me forever to start are getting done without the usual last-minute panic.",

      "content": "Many of you are familiar with the Zeigarnik Effect. It suggests that we tend to keep unfinished tasks in our memory until theyre completed. Our mental space is constantly occupied by thought loops. Heres an example: I made a decision at work that others might criticize. Later at home, my mind keeps spinning, going over justifications, possible reactions, and so on... Or I have an upcoming appointment, and my social anxiety keeps coming up with endless scenarios where I might have to justify myself. Or Ive been thinking for months about buying something specific. There are also thought spirals that settle in over months and years, taking up mental capacity. All of these things stay in my head at the same time, until theyre dealt with and take up my mental storage. What helps (at least for me): Lets say you have an appointment in a week and you already know your mind will spiral until then. Open an app and write everything that comes to mind about it, along with the date. What would you do in situation X or Y? How do you feel about it? Why are you even going? Be aware that you're transferring mental load onto another medium and your brain will feel relieved afterward. And if new thoughts pop up later, you can simply add them. On the day of the appointment, you can review everything and feel well prepared. And this doesn't just apply to appointments it works for any kind of mental clutter. Thinking about buying something and constantly weighing your options? Make a note and update it over time. Feeling anxious, dissatisfied, or distracted? Create a note and write down your thoughts with no pressure or stress. Its all about reflection and giving your mind some peace from those overwhelming thoughts. Youve been procrastinating your studies for weeks or even months? That alone takes up an incredible amount of mental space. Instead of distracting yourself and constantly feeling uneasy, write about it to gain some distance. For many of you, this post might seem very simple, especially if you already journal or are fully aware of this idea. But for me, Ive only just come to the realization of how incredibly helpful it is to keep a clear, uncluttered mind while still having all my problems and plans written down somewhere. Our brain isnt made to hold lots of information at once its made to find creative solutions. Even at work, I write down everything that happens and might be relevant for the next shift. Often, it adds up to 10-20 things. Even if they seem minor, it feels amazing to know: I dont have to keep it all in my head my thoughts are saved somewhere and ready when I need them. Maybe Im the last idiot to come to this realization but this simple change has helped me a lot and even if it helps just one person here, Id be really happy about that.",

Today for example, I have a zoom yoga class at 7pm, and Ive spent the entire day almost mentally consumed by it and preparing for it. It doesnt make me anxious or anything, its just like this giant, heavy, unmovable block at the end of my day.

I've seen plenty of positive reviews of Journal and after using it for some time myself I saw that the search function isn't very good it's practically almost useless even if I use the specific words I used in my entries, it's easy to accidentally delete entries if you aren't careful, the image storage is really amazing but you can't save your images or do anything with them other than deleting so it ends up being kind of useless unless you're willing to take a bunch of screenshots of images you stored in the app, and the UI, while being easy to get the hang of, eventually becomes boring to look at, which makes writing journals feel more like a chore. I have many disabilities, physical and mental, which already makes writing a diary difficult for me. So there won't really be a \"fix\" to how long I will be able to maintain a diary. What I want, instead of a \"complete fix,\" is something that is able to cater to my needs for the time being. I have many things I am trying to accomplish right now, most especially a food diary and my workouts I do every month. Having a diary also helps me with my memory loss. So I would like to maintain this for awhile until I get to a certain weight goal and hopefully somewhat of a better cognitive state. To get to my specific needs, I would like to find a diary app that: - Has large  unlimited image storage, able to be resaved and possibly hold image dates (Similar or same as Journal's images with dates feature) - Feature that removes multiple entries at once or a few at a time (Not required but would be highly convenient) - Visually Appealing  Customizable Appearances or Themes - Easy to Use, preferably a UI that isn't super cluttered and still looks great - Able to store transferred data from Journal (Also not required but would be very convenient...) I am willing to pay for one-time payments with the diary app as long as it is useful. I thought about trying \"My Diary -- Daily Diary Journal\" as a replacement but upon downloading I've already encountered some bugs...which aren't heartbreaking but still somewhat inconvenient and makes me wonder if the one-time purchase would even be worth the price...I also am not sure if there's a feature that transfers Journal data. So...any suggestions would be appreciated! 3",

      "content": "My uncle, who has not one but two PhDs, reads one book a week. Some of my fondest memories with him were our trips bashing about London, going to every used bookstore. He reads everything, from politics to history to cooking to books on how to write. It always amazed me as a boy, though I didnt understand why he read SO much. He reads more than anyone else I ever met before or since. So I asked once in my teenage years why he kept on reading so much well into his fifties and sixties. Heres what he told me: Lad, I dont remember 90 of the material Ive read. Im not reading to memorise certain facts or to have a bank of useful information to pull from later. I read because its edifying. It changes the way I think, even if just for a moment, and what the brain forgets, the body remembers. Im a different person now than I would have been had I not read so much, even if the majority of the content is wiped clean from my memory. Dont read to learn for the future; read to learn right now. It will change you and your perspective without you ever noticing. Thats why I read and will continue to read. You ever have a moment thats life changing, even if you dont realise it at the time? That was one of those fundamental, core moments for me. Even now, 15 years later, I still aim to read a book a week (though admittedly it takes me a bit longer than my uncle). And after reading hundreds of books, articles, and essays in my life, I can say that he was right. I dont remember hardly any of what I read, but thats ok. Reading has changed me in ways I couldnt imagine. Its widen my interests, my perspective, my vocabulary. And I know without a doubt I would not be who I am today had I not read so much. Dont read to learn for the future. Read to learn now. Your mind will forget most of what you learn, but the core foundation of who you are will remember.",

Also, I get to practice writing in Japanese so I can brush up on my proficiency (even though its still 100), and so no one can read my journal for the most part. はっはは I try to write everyday but in reality I skip a day or so, especially on my days off when Im out and about but Im so happy with how its coming along.

They asked if there was anything I'd like to tell them, confused, I pressed until they asked if there was anything I'd written in my journal. Whatever I wrote is irrelevant. A journal is meant to be a safe space to process the world around me. Happy, sad, angry, doesn't matter. Process. My partner took that feeling of security from me. I've been journalling for years and I've never felt as insecure as I've felt this year putting my thoughts on paper. Journalling has been the anchor for my functionality; I spiralled this year because for 5 months after my journal was \"raided\", I was unable to journal. I picked up journalling again in May. It's been inconsistent; I've not been able to shake off the feeling of insecurity. To regain that feeling of security, I thought of using a redacting pen this month. I don't have that yet but I want to journal consistently again, and that means feeling safe. I've gone back through my current journal and scribbled out my entries. I scanned my entries before doing that so I could always have some memory of my entries. I hated the scribbling, it goes against what I believe a journal should be, but it's where I'm at. I guess I'm looking for solidarity. Have you had issues with security and how did you get through to that?",

My parents regularly betrayed my trust that way when I was a teenager. They thought nothing of it. In fact, my father told me to my face just last month that he went through an affirmations journal I'd kept last year because \"it had fallen on the floor and was open\". To put this in context, I'm in my late 20s now. All this time and all those years and they still do not know what they did wrong. I don't know if your partner journals, but my parents dont- so maybe it's a non-journaler thing. They don't know what it means to be vulnerable and so they don't see they're exploiting someone's vulnerability. Or maybe it's a certain type of person thing, because I can't for the life of me understand how someone can't realize it. All this to say- I don't think this is a problem that will go away. Not unless you and your partner are willing to have a very frank discussion about what they did. And not if your partner doesn't respect your boundaries and your privacy. I dealt with it (as a teenager) by crying, yelling, trying to hide my journals which would inevitably be ferreted out by my parents, and then creating a whole new written language system to write in instead when I eventually realized that security was non-existent. I dealt with it last month by walking out of the room midway through my father telling me he'd betrayed my trust yet again. He's not someone you can have open discussions with so there was no point in trying. Physically exiting out of the conversation was an act of self-preservation. I take my journal wherever I go now. And I hide it in better places when I have to leave it behind. It is what it is. The thought of you scribbling out your previous entries hurts my heart. I hope you find your way through this, OP.",

I made it a priority to also note down positive things and I think it's helped me have a more positive approach to each day. It also is nice to see my thoughts organized on paper, helps me keep a clear head. I incorporate stickers and some art (although I do have a section solely for sketches) to make it look pretty. I find it fun and relaxing and it honestly gives me something to look forward to upon waking up.",

I knew I was struggling mentally and that I needed to do something to get myself out of this spiral. I have fallen into depression before, but as I have gotten older it is harder to lift myself out of these periods. I reached out to one of my only friends and confided in her that I needed to start doing something that allowed me to ask for help, and asked if she wanted to do a journaling challenge with me. I knew I wanted to improve things before my birthday, which was three months out. I was a little nervous to ask her, but she enthusiastically agreed and we decided to set our start dates together and do weekly check-ins. Three months have elapsed and I cannot express how grateful and amazed I am that journaling has channeled my energy and helped clear my mind. Although I didn't reach EVERY goal I set for myself in these three months, I made substatial progress in physical, mental, monetary, and emotional health and also started building steady habits. I feel like I never want to stop journaling, and having this small book that has documented my progress across this period is so powerful. I feel so inspired by journaling, and just wanted to express my adoration for this process and group. I got so much inspiration from what I read in this subreddit. Thank you",
