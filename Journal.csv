iOS App Store,13092031222,4,Journalist of 2025,"For me, as someone who loves writing, this app is really cool! At 15 i’m writing a book and sometimes do short story competitions, but just having a topic and writing a paragraph about is just so fun. I love going back to journal entries I did years ago and reading about what I was  struggling about then. It’s so cool, for me anyway, because the things and the people I was deeply struggling with I don’t anymore. That’s just so encouraging for me to see how God has really worked in my life. One verse I write a lot about is Jeremiah 29:11 “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you, not to harm you. Plans to give you a hope and a future.” I would usually write this verse after I wrote about what I was struggling with, and going back and rereading it and just seeing how God does have plans for me and they are for my good. Even if life feels hard is really encouraging. Something I came up with while writing is, “A fire will burn and destroy, yes. But the growth and new life that comes after is a fresh start to what once was.” God can do this as well. It’s through our pain and suffering, like a fire, that can start to break and weaken us, but it’s the through that that we learn and grow. Nothing bad happens for no reason. God always has a plan, for the lost or for the found. He always cares. My God is a loving God. And he has done, and will continue to do, great things for us. Because he loves us.",123 😊,2025-09-02T17:20:58-07:00,0,0,1.3,,1756858858

iOS App Store,13048239734,5,Ease of use,Journaling app is an easy to use app as I could quickly make a journal entry without so much effort. I used the dictation feature which works 96% at a time with very little need to correct spelling. I’m getting into the habit of using this journaling app with the hopes of recording my lifetime experiences so I could relive them when my mind isn’t so good.

I wish it was available across all iOS devices, it would be cool if there was a way to hand write journals on the iPad with the pencil/pro (that too me seems like such a home run) also some of the days events don’t show up till the next day, sometimes I’d like to write about those events the day of. But otherwise this app is fantastic, such a great way to convey your thoughts and feelings without conveying anything publicly.

iOS App Store,13023110551,3,So convenient but would like to seamlessly work between iPhone and laptop,"Such a great and easy way to journal. I wish I could use it on my phone (for spontaneity & ease) while also accessing it on my MacBook Air to add photos and make a book out of it. Adding photos would help me easily remember and visualize events. Looking for one seamless experience that’s easy. Having to move all of this to my airbook is cumbersome and time consuming. Apple is supposed to provide amazing, innovative experiences, so please get on this for journalers. Props to spontaneously writing and making notes though. 

If this “journal” is just for spontaneous notes and”mindfulness,” perhaps you could build another more robust option that works across platforms just like notes and calendar for more journalers who want to do more than be mindful.

iOS App Store,13017368602,5,Genuinely satisfied,"I recently discovered this pre-downloaded app, and it’s been so nice to document my thoughts. I usually hate the streak feature in apps, but it keeps me accountable for my days, and I’m thankful to record my thoughts daily— it’s fun getting to see how my mind works day to day. I am also obsessed with the fact that there is a recording feature; there are lots of days where I despise the thought of typing, so it helps loads to keep the streak (ugh I know) and, more importantly, keep me accountable and consistent.

She’s totally fine though it’s just like a common cold but ever since I wrote in it like a few minutes ago I just felt so much better and I was crying before I wrote in the journal too, and once I started writing in the journal, I stopped Like no more tears was coming out, and I was able to breathe normally again because when I cry, I start breathing all huffy and puffy so this journal really helps with a lot of things you should get it.

What I have said sounds nothing like any of the letters or the syllables of the words does not make any darn sense. I would prefer to receive just a blank space awaiting which I have had happen but not as often as I have had horrible changes, text notes. To make changes it extremely difficult if you’ve tried to change two words you won’t know exactly what I mean you you’re starting where you put your finger, the cursor, blinking or not doesn’t always register.

The clean design makes journaling feel more intentional, and I like how the app encourages reflection without being overwhelming.

It’s still early days, but I can already see the potential for this to become a regular part of my routine—especially for organizing thoughts, spiritual reflections, or just slowing down for a few mindful moments. I’m looking forward to exploring more features as I go.

Up until April 7th, 2023, I’ve stopped daily journaling (a whopping 1,090 entries worth getting through the pandemic has really paid off). Until May 5th (same year… and 4 weeks later), I made a tough decision to return to journaling, but after a segment of the journal, I took a 2-week break from it before moving onto the next segment, same with how I took a 4-week break after I finish the entire journal before grabbing a new one.

iOS App Store,12667339984,5,Best Journal App Ever,"I absolutely love journaling. It is a great way to capture personal growth on a regular basis. We learn and grow by reflecting upon both greater and minor challenges and experiences.

Journal is an intuitive tool to keep track of life as we go along with lifelong learning. We can do the standard old school practice of writing. 

Using speech to text makes rapid journaling possible. I can quickly transcribe thought more quickly and efficiently than simply typing. When the mind is racing with thought or incite, it is hard to stay focused and capture thoughts. Technology helps capture this fleeting moments with ease.

In addition to text, we can add pictures and charts and other helpful aids to entries. This may help visualize complex ideas or provide a visual storyboard to add color to a topic or emotion. We can make a masterpiece.

Journal makes regular journaling easier by scheduling reminders. I get notified on my Apple Watch, iPhone, and MacBook every few days so I don’t neglect my mental health. It helps in many ways!

I like to add a summary of the things I did to the end of my entries. The formatting options leave a lot to be desired. Unless I’m just not looking in the right spot (which would make it not very intuitive anyway!) there’s no option to make the text bigger, only the standard bold, underline, italic and strike through. I completely understand this isn’t a word processing app, but I know there are other journal apps that do have these functions, such as changing the text styles for headings, subheadings, etc. Also, I decided I’d try to utilize the options that are built in and settled on the style that creates a line before the text as my “heading style”. My issue is the toolbar to select the style gets in the way of typing, so I have to hit the x and close it before I can see what I’m typing. Scrolling down doesn’t help, you have to hit the x first. Then if I want to change the color of it, once I select the color I have to hit the x for the color selector, then x for the toolbar and wait because if I tap the screen too quickly, the selected text (which I needed to do to change the color!) gets deleted or written over because the keyboard and toolbar pop up automatically but with a delay.

Anyone can write about anything and you should just write about whatever you want. Personally, I just write about whatever I feel like writing, but it’s mostly recaps about what happened in the day so I know that my day was productive and useful and I can reflect back to previous days to see what I did that day.

I’ve been using it since April of 2024, and have loved it. 

However since I’ve been using it for so long, I’ve noticed downsides. For starters, you can’t upload voice memos you have saved; I figured this out whilst trying to add a 12 minute long audio memo from a few days prior and found that you can only record new ones. It would be great if there was an option to upload old voice recordings in place of typing all its content or saying it again.

Additionally, it would be neat if you could add photos in the middle of the text like in the notes app; It would be easier to have a picture with whatever details are attached to it underneath, instead of all the videos and pictures going to the top by default.

The last thing is the lack of a trash section. Because of the way the app is set up, sometimes I swipe right and accidentally delete my entry entirely. Instead of having entries instantly purged, allow to undo with the shake feature, or at least go back into trash and retrieve them.

I feel like these things could improve the app significantly, but nonetheless I will continue to use it because it still works nice.",Cheese Popsicle,2025-04-13T22:09:19-07:00,0,0,1.2,,1744607359

1) There’s no “Command Z” type function, so if I accidentally delete something, everything is just gone— pretty distressing. 

2) When you make a photo attachment, it doesn’t embed into the journal entry like it does in “Notes”, it just leaves it awkwardly at the top— which I think needs to be changed. 

3) Same with the voice notes, it would be better if the voice notes could be embedded. 

4) A simpler way to access your bookmarked journal entries.

I started to feel lighter and get past depression and my own way so I still have a little bit of it to this day but it’s not as bad as it was when I was younger, so I’m glad I got through it the way I did with the journal. It was so much better than it could’ve been. I could’ve been stuck in that endless loop for lifetime but ever since writing it down in that diary just makes me feel better.

This app being preinstalled on my phone helped *enormously* in getting me to journal. It has helped me immensely, by finally being able to put all my thoughts down somewhere. I get reminders to write, and I always get something in even if it’s something small. I love being able to log my mood and share things directly to it as well, like if I’m listening to a song a lot I can link it directly and express how it makes me feel; I do this with other things too, often a lot of the “suggested” options which I really appreciate. I don’t use them always, but I find them very useful and they help me write more. It also helps me bring things up to my therapist, having worked out my emotions already in a written format so we can go over things in a more efficient manner.
It’s simple, it’s user friendly, it’s fine-tuned to my everyday experience. It’s the only journal app that has ever grabbed me and kept me using it.

Also, not enough variety with the questions, there’s only a small rotation so after not that long you would’ve answered them all. (I think) Also might be a small bug, or just me being dumb, but whenever I add another entry it doesn’t even give me the option for the questions anymore. It just has me start typing and I can’t see those questions. But overall it is a good way to work on writing skills, answer questions, work on mental health and that stuff.

The office as well designed and I often use the journal suggestions. 

This is one of the few notifications that I do not get tired of, and I'm glad that this app is apart of a device that is a reflection of the user with the ability of the user to communicate to their experience within that same device.

Maybe one day they will incorporate ways to publish our review a journal by a friend. Or designate what should happen to the journal in the event that someone passes away.

Also, it stinks that you can’t search by date in the office to scroll and there’s no calendar for you to where you can go back and pick a day.

Journal is what I wanted in the Apple ecosystem… if it was fully in the ecosystem. I believe I understand what Apple wanted from this app; an app where people could micro-blog during the day.

For these two latter, a real keyboard, like the ones found on Macs and iPads. All styles could coexist!

There’s sort of a workaround using iPhone Mirroring, one can use the Mac to type into the iPhone app. It works well, still cumbersome.

4. Let me set a different passcode than the one I use for my device. My spouse and kids have access to my phone passcode.

If I had one suggestion, it would be to allow users to continue voice notes from where they left off. That small addition would make the app even better, though it’s already close to perfect.

I think it’s cool and looks like a book cover, but most of the time, I have the perfect picture but it only shows part of it, and it doesn’t work. 3, (last one) I don’t think this app lets me change my words’ font, and I think it’d be cool if I could customize that sort of thing, like background or font and stuff.

I do hope to provide some feedback, and not sure where to do that at, so I’m doing it here.. the biggest issue I have, and it’s become problematic hence the 3 stars, is that the (x) button to delete a voice entry is right under the done button, and if you have any issues with shaking, dexterity, depth perception, or any vision issues, it makes it far too easy to delete a voice entry. And sometimes, mine are long, so this is exceedingly inconvenient and I hope gets resolved quickly.. even if they just put the (x) on the other side of the memo so it doesn’t perfectly align underneath the done button that would be great.

The Mac's iPhone Mirroring app helps, but why is there no direct way to use it on the iPad or Mac? The iPad is the perfect journaling tool to me and many others.

Apple Journal is absolutely fantastic if you’re open to the features that it has. First things first. Everything is searchable. And they are premade categories. While #Tags aren’t official in Journal, they are still searchable. That’s really all you need to make this a productivity system if you really wanted to. You can copy and paste transcripts within journal too, which is awesome. 

This isn’t the big feature missing that I want to talk about, but you have the ability to categorize by music and podcasts that you can add from Apple’s respective apps, but for some reason you can’t categorize by links you copy in from Safari. I feel like given all of the other categories, this is something that just makes sense. 

All that being said the one thing that I think is missing that I feel would work phenomenally well here is the ability to add transcripts from sounds in videos into Journal entries. While it isn’t necessary per se, I think it would be a nice feature. This also gives the speech the ability to be searched since it is in text form as well. There is even a use case for it when it comes to making content. 

Given all of that, it’s something that I feel like would be really native to the Apple Journal and the ecosystem in general.",AdamIsaacPena,2024-12-13T20:21:41-07:00,0,0,1.2,,1734146501

After the recent update, I have two suggestions to improve the user experience.

First, when making a new entry, I think the cursor should start on the content, rather than the title. I like the titles, but many entries don’t warrant a title, and manually moving the cursor to the content is an extra step. If an entry is deliberate enough to have a title, I think the user won’t mind making the extra tap.

Second, an option to hide/toggle the statistics on the timeline. These are fun to look at and I appreciate their addition, but I would only want to see them every month or so. I would rather have a clean timeline otherwise.

Here are some ideas:

1) Create an option for separate  journals on the app. This allows for more organization as opposed to miscellaneous journal entries. For instance on my app I like to write about several subjects including my mental, physical, and relational health, and I find it overwhelming and difficult to find a specific prompt when I want to reflect. It would be nice to be able to see the actual “journal cover” along with its title. By clicking on the journal it would redirect you to another page similar to the current layout of the app. Inspiration for the seller are journals comes from the app “good notes” 

2) more fonts and layout options. I would love to have the option to change font, size, and color in my journal. It allows for more opportunity for creativity

No one wants a journal with the native-Apple look!!,"If you are looking for a dull journal app with a not-so-friendly GUI—why is Apple so obsessed with this cold, ultramodern look?—and a non-customizable font and background, this is the app for you. To each their own. I get it. However, if you are looking for a journal app that is welcoming and that encourages you to keep typing in it, there are many options for you. This is not one; find another app.
     As this app is as basic as basic can get, I will not prattle on and on about it. There is nothing more to say. Wait, why am I still going? Why are YOU still reading? Go! Begone! NOW!

iOS App Store,11397511147,1,"Looks great, but useless without key features","Needs search and tagging at the minimum. I’m shocked they released it without search frankly.

2 starts because it looks pretty and it’s easy to use. Everything else is a joke - this is a Hello World level app in terms of features relative to its peers. Like a demo app. Hoping iOS 18 makes this a real contender.

Total missing features before this is a real
journal app to me:
- search
- tagging
- basic formatting (easier ways to bold, italic, heading, bulleted lists)
- full copy and paste support - text is arguable going to be more sensitive, and I can copy/paste that no problem. But photos are spotty - some apps they wont copy and paste from.
- sharing, and saving, a photo from an existing entry. The privacy reasoning behind it is weak as mentioned above. No good reason to block this wholesale
- bulk export in a useable format for backups
- bulk import, of that same useable format - so a backup can be restored if disaster or user error strikes

Nice to haves:
- grab location and weather for every entry
- recycling bin, for restoring accidental entry deletions
- version history, for restoring accidental text deletions that wouldnt be applicable for the recycling bin.",Kevin 72638393,2024-06-18T20:36:12-07:00,0,0,1.1,,1718768172
iOS App Store,11373504535,5,A little more than basic,"I found this app one random morning while the sun had yet to come up. I’ve been randomly using it for basic things like dream journaling, checking in with feelings, and some random ideas here and there. Pros: I love that I can add pictures. Write long entries. No pop up adds. Private suggestions to write about. Reflection questions to think about and write.  And copy and paste to words with not so much of an issue. Cons: There’s no fonts to chose from. The list of entries goes from latest to earliest and only gives you options to pick up from “all entries” or “pictures” only. This app is not available on IPad. 

Suggestion to developer: More fonts. Create Folders for entries. Make it available for IPad. 

Overall for a free app, it’s basic and smooth and it’s yet to crash on me and I write volumes. It is totally worth the hype for creating entries without the complication of other apps, just simple and basic font with the ability to add a picture if that’s what anybody else wants. If it were available on IPad this would be my go to app for doing basic planning, ideas, journaling and dream journaling.",azariellf,2024-06-12T09:49:38-07:00,3,3,1.1,,1718210978

iOS App Store,11366649687,4,Does what it says on the tin,"For a truly free to use app, this is brilliant. 

Pros:
- Face ID to open the app for security 
- Add all forms of media with fairly quick upload time. Video, photos, voice notes even. 
- Allows you to organise thumbnails at the top of the journal entry 
- You can bookmark entries so they’re easier to find
- It’s by Apple so design quality is nice
- Again, no ads 

Cons: 
- No search function, this is crucial 
- Would be nice to the skip new entry screen 
- Keyboard has an “insert lock” issue if you’re typing anywhere except at the end of a sentence. Text cursor jumps automatically to end of sentence. 

All these additions can be easily added or fixed though, so I’m not sure why people are complaining so much about the *early* version of fully functioning *free* app that’s only 5 months old. 

Keep the updates coming as it’s close to perfect. If anything, after search function and bug fixes, less updates would probably be better as the simplicity of this app is what makes it great. Please don’t over-engineer it <3",Qubed123,2024-06-10T14:04:22-07:00,0,0,1.1,,1718053462

iOS App Store,11315344128,4,Listen Apple,"So here’s what I think this app could use to revamp it into something incredible. One- it’s a journaling app, where are the; Fonts, ability to play around with drawing, italics, bolds, letter spacing etc. Two- it’s annoying that you can’t organize each “tab” as you’d like to. What if I wanna rearrange the order- have current writings I’m working on at the top while moving some to the bottom (it’s overwhelming having to scroll all the way up and down). Three- It would be cool to place them into Folders, keeping them tidy and under specific Titles of your choosing. Four- it would be great to organize and edit the photos you add TO YOUR LIKING. Last but not least Five- it seems Apple doesn’t wanna get into the whole colored font thing, but it could be a real eye appeal to be able to do so, it would pair nicely with the whole font optional combo. Matter of fact here’s number Six because this one’s a MUST- it’s incredibly annoying that every time I click to edit it automatically scrolls straight to the bottom (who said I wanted that lol)? Just open up just as the notes and pages app does.

- not available on iPad or Macs

It’s lacking some key features for sure but nothing that can’t be added on later on. Some entries are too long on the iPhone so I type it in Notes and then copy and paste it into the Journal app.

I would love to have different journals as well. For example, mood tracking, dream journal, gratitude, personal, work, etc. 

The background color is not a huge deal, just would be nice to pick one. It can still be kept simple by just giving people 8 or so options to choose from.

All the effort of collecting, constructing, imagining, recollecting, and editing are locked in what can only be described as an un-openable coffin - buried in your Apple device. This is not useful.

There's a bookmark you can add to more personal posts, to make them easier to find, and while I'd like new ways of navigating all the posts you've written to be added in the future, this app is beautiful in its simplicity.

iOS App Store,11179159590,4,Love it but needs more?,"Came across this app a couple weeks ago re-organizing my home screen. This app is definitely interesting as far as being interactive with other apps like; photos, activity/health, communication and locations. There’s several other apps i believe apple could potentially integrate later that would make a huge difference like; notes, weather, and maybe even music apps (i say this as i, do not use apple music). 
I also think as the app develops, the ability to customize your journal to your style could be a key creative aspect they’ll miss if they don’t do it. Customizations like; 
-editing photo arrangements in entries. whether it’s within the photo or the photo within the entries themselves. 
-being able to write around the app blurbs. 

Idk i’m just a normal person, no tech nerd. overall, the ability to individualize this app would take it far.",wydhanns,2024-04-19T19:39:18-07:00,0,0,1.1,,1713580758

•1: when you look at journaling suggestions, some of them kind of force you to record yourself, not everyone wants to allow microphone access (I don’t have problems with it for the record, just putting this in for yall)

•2: I feel like it needs more work on the structure of the app, compared to other journaling apps.

•3: I would like to see more creative entry suggestions,(here is one): write down what you did today and include any photos if you have them. 

•4: I would LOVE a little like lock within the app.i know that most phones have passwords, but i usually sometimes let my friends do stuff on my phone and I don’t really want them reading all my personal info stuff

iOS App Store,11158803744,1,Journal app needs to be able to print entries,"I thoroughly enjoyed using the journal feature on a recent 10 day road trip. My phone is always handy so I didn’t need to wait and write down my thoughts at the end of each day. Being able to include photos was an extra perk. 
So I was very disappointed to get back home and discover there is no way to print my travel journal. There’s no way to send anything to my laptop. After reading a few reviews, I found out I’m not the only one to be discouraged by this. 
Some people suggested taking screenshots of each entry, but I quickly found this to be very cumbersome for my purposes. I ended up using my old-school skills and propped my phone up next to my laptop and transcribed my entries into Pages. From there it was easy to print. 
Including pictures required a couple of extra steps. The oddest surprise was discovering that a photo taken with the Journal camera is not saved in with all our other photos. In that case, I had only used that feature once so I was lucky in that regard.
With these limitations, the journal is actually nothing more than a glorified Notes app.

However, I am indeed alive and well so there is no need to worry. I was simply enjoying the tactic of figurative language in order to better and more effectively communicate my message.

Additionally, using slang and saying commonly employed by the youth has made my message more understandable and reachable for the younger generation, many whom are in this chat. For example, I could have said ""that was a knee slapper""

'this may have made sense to the older generation in this chat as knee slapping used to be a sign or hilarity. However, this digital age which we now live, knee slapping is not as common and many of today's youth may not understand the joke, so I chose to resort in a different and rather new tone of language.

3. Should have basic formatting such as bold,italic, underline and some colors. 
4. It would be better if we could insert pictures inline instead of all of them getting grouped together at the top of an entry.

iOS App Store,11114449926,1,Thanks for yet another overhyped but deeply flawed app,"This app was glitchy to begin with; not responding to keyboard input, cut/paste not working, deleting entire paragraphs when I only needed to delete a word…
Now for the past 4 days it won’t even open. Rather, it does open but is frozen on a blank screen. I can’t see previous entries, can’t add a new one, nothing. Months of writing just gone. I’ve read the user forums, tried the advice on tech forums and support sites, uninstalled/reinstalled the app, restarted the phone, allowed all the notifications, disallowed all the notifications, toggled features on and off and nothing has worked. 
This app is a microcosm of how the entire Apple “ecosystem” has devolved into total garbage. Apps that don’t function properly, devices more focused on appearance and superficial improvements than functionality, accessories that fail after only months of use…and overall, a company more focused on creating a “lifestyle” than making things that actually work. I don’t have the vocabulary to express how utterly awful Apple has become. If I wasn’t so irretrievably entrenched in it I’d jump ship to another platform. Apple, you are just a terrible, terrible company. Here’s a tip: I don’t need a phone made of titanium or moon dust or whatever, I don’t need 14 different voices for Siri.

With the journaling app all photos are cropped in a really unusual way so your feed doesn’t show the full photo, nor does it center the photo. For me the whole point of a digital journal is to be able to easily incorporate photos and have my daily photos readily accessible when I need encouragement. This app does not provide that. In order to see your photo you have to click on each individual entry. Why they can’t have the photo visible in its entirety like many of the other apps is beyond me. I hope they fix this soon.

- There is next to no formatting options for the text of each entry (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough) and it’s tricky to access them.

- There is no personalized template feature. This feature is integral for me and I don’t understand how it detracts from the minimalist concept. After all, what’s more simplistic than having a basic prompt used to plug and chug?

- Most importantly, entries in the app completely lack any kind of organization. As far as I’m aware, journaling or note taking apps always have a simplistic categorization or tagging feature for entries. It’s bizarre that Apple neglected this cornerstone of functionality.

Look, I’m not asking for a full on virtual scrapbook here - just basic cross platform functionality and a few no brainer features like being able to take a landscape photo without being stuck looking at it sideways.

Same with videos (and voice memos, though I don’t really mid about that). The Notes app has that feature, which I like. 
Sometimes when I write, it glitches a bit, and part of my sentence disappears, which bothers me. Like, I write a sentence and it just deletes what I just wrote.

It collected honestly all the best photos and picked all the ones I would have picked.

There are so many things that are missing. Basic things really. 

1) change titles
2) link to rest of photos or media wherever the source is. Like I review old entires and I’d like to link to the photo back in photos so I can see the rest of the related photos. (Since I can only select a limited number)
3) SHARE!  Why can’t I share it?? I want to share to other iPhone users and also non iPhone users. 
3) this one really kills me as it’s a BIG missed opportunity. Memories in phone can’t be linked to or include a ‘memory’ in photos??  Like strange. I would think memories in photos kind of overlaps with this??? I don’t want to manage them separately. Needs more continuity here fore sure. Combine them into journal and take them out of photos.

Another issue is, once i add photos to a post, i cant rearrange them, make my journal more appealing to me, the software arranges photos and sets a face photo for that post itself.

The UI is pleasant and nice. However, it would be neat to have the ability to create different journals, folders, or some organization system because I have been trying to find an app that would allow me to keep separate journals for just personal daily use and especially for tracking my dreams after I wake up.

Pop it open, maybe select from the auto-generated list of suggested items and make a note about your day. Would love to use it and replace Day One (my current journaling app), BUT… it is missing some basic features that would indicate it is here to stay, rather than being an exploratory “hmm, maybe this could be cool” app that Apple might retire in a couple of years (remember Music Memos?) 

Until it is available on iPadOS and macOS, until there is at least a Notes-like tagging and folder system, and most importantly until there is an option to batch export in some clean markdown format that guarantees we will retain control of our notes and be able to access them past the end of Journal or switching to another platform, I can’t recommend using it.

You can just straight up read the entries without clicking on them. But it won’t let me lock the app unless I have a lock on my phone.

Here is how I journal: Growing up, I always treated journaling as a journal prompt the way we would do it in grade school. So I would sit down to write about something, but instead of letting my thoughts flow, I would answer like a prompt if that makes any sense.  The way I journal is I ask myself a question. It could be a very simple question like how was your day or what’s on my mind right now and all I do is I take what pops up in my head and I transcribe that into the app. So I am literally transcribing my thoughts and what I have learned is that my thoughts flow and I’m able to process thoughts instead of just keep them up in my head and that’s how I use this journaling app. I hope that helps. ❤️

There is no way to remove individual suggestions or refresh the photo based ones.

This isn’t a problem yet, but eventually I will have many entries and won’t be able to easily scroll to the bottom. Too bad! This app doesn’t have a keyword or tag based search function, so good luck finding what you wrote about a particular event from 3 years ago!

It is buggy right now and keeps jumping to the bottom of the page in the middle of voice dictation or typing. This is very annoying to have to scroll back up and click in the correct spot. Voice dictation normally jumps back to the right spot when you talk again after a pause but it constantly spastically jumps from your spot to the bottom and then back up.

Features I believe are great would be responding to the prompts, adding location, and adding pictures into the entries. The pictures are a unique addition because whenever I journal in a book, I never add pictures since it’s tedious to print pictures and go pick them up from the store, and it’s a long time to wait for them to be shipped.

Ability to organize my entries by topics or buckets to separate journal entries that are specific to a particular activity or topic. Also the ability to organize or pin bookmarked entries to make allow me to make some front and center.

Additionally I would like the ability to create templates where I would like to provide some prompts for my entry. 

Lastly, the ability to sort and group entries over periods of time such as Months or Years so they can filed away in an organized way and avoid a never ending list on the journal view.

It wasn’t suggesting the photos I recently took so I created a new blank entry. Either I don’t know how to do headers or headers are only available for suggested journal entries. I created a new blank journal entry, but I never got the header option so everything I wrote is in bold header format. 

I put a lot of time into an audio note and when I was finished, I loved that it was there. However, I didn’t see any way to export it to any other application or save it anywhere. It’s a safe and secure way to store your journal but there’s no way to export it or give anyone access. It’s a note for an ongoing idea but I have no way to tag it or export it. Share ability? What if I want to share this with my kids? Do I have to give them access to my full iPhone just to get it? I have no way of putting this in any other format? In my opinion journals are for future generations. Yeah, it’s nice to look back on your own history but I want it for my kids and one day grandkids, I’m not sure what the point is if I can’t export anything, I can’t customize it, and I can’t share it.

I would say this had so much potential. The app is glitchy the more I use it. If I have a longer journal entry, it is hard to view the bottom of the entry because the keyboard covers it. 

Another glitch is that when I underline a word it will underline in black and not white like the colors of the  letters. 

Lastly, I find myself constantly wanted to format the text differently and have an easier way of adjusting the format rather than highlighting, tapping, choosing format, then choosing bold, italics etc. not to mention if I want bold underline I have to do it twice.

Many of which happen via our Apple devices already. 

However, for it to truly be useful a number of basic things are missing, amongst others:
1. The ability to attach an unlimited amount of photos and videos
2. The ability to show Photos and videos on a map view like in the “photos” app to see where one was that day or week and click through it that way

Apple, please implement these, you are onto something great, but only if you make this a broad featured app rather than keeping it minimal and high level like you prefer keeping your apps.

* Allow adding timestamps to journal entries. When looking back, it would be nice to know if you wrote about a picture just after it was taken or later in the day
* Allow adding tags to journal entries. It would make it better organized 
* Add some more text styling options, like bullet points, tables, numbered lists, etc.

I need to be able to type with a keyboard for long texts. The Notes app is a very simple app, often too simple compared to other notes apps such as EverNote (which I use heavily for fancier notes that I need to keep “forever”) or even Microsoft OneNote is much more powerful than the Notes app; downside is that these other notes apps are not “free”. The Journal app looks prettier than the Notes app, but I am not sure what the value is if I can’t access it on my Mac and other deficiencies that people had listed here (lack of folders, labels, etc.); hopefully these will be available in a couple years, then I’d definitely consider it. If I can do away with EverNote by then, even better.",sundude-sls,2023-10-31T21:34:49-07:00,2,4,1.0,,1698813289
iOS App Store,10530436177,5,Journaling Made Seamless and Inspiring,"First time writing a review for the App Store, and it’s well-deserved. I’ve been anticipating this release since it was demonstrated at WWDC ‘23 since journaling is something I’ve always aspired to do throughout daily life, but I just never managed to hold onto. I feel this will be the key to that. Having a native App that has the potential to integrate with our other iOS features/services opens up an entirely new and immersive way to creatively express our daily selves for ourselves and for others. 

Journal is clean and simple thus far which keeps you focused on YOU when using it. The App allows you to attach photos to your entries as well as songs and location tags to further enhance and draw references to your experiences. It even allows verbal entries through the use of Voice Memos if typing isn’t ideal for you. The fact that it has built-in Face ID reminds you that security and privacy are still paramount in Apple’s design language for its native Apps. Truly a gift to one’s mind and routine. 🙂",HeyitsDonnie,2023-10-29T22:35:20-07:00,7,9,1.0,,1698644120
iOS App Store,10525909112,5,So Far So Good,"As a person who journals a lot, I’m loving the app so far. It’s really great, and I especially love the design and aesthetic the most. Some features which would be nice to have for someone like me includes:

*The ability to input the current time (not date) as a text within the contents of an entry with one tap. Useful for people who time-block their journals. 

*The ability to insert images within the contents of an entry. It’s lovely that images act as covers for an entry, but that shouldn’t take away from the ability to place them within an entry. They can be two separate decisions.  
*The ability to set more than one daily reminder to journal. Helpful for people who, perhaps, journal in the morning and night, or do so at intermittent intervals of their day.

Thank you, that’s all.",LostMass,2023-10-28T15:14:18-07:00,0,0,1.0,,1698531258
iOS App Store,10522895223,1,Initial Thoughts,"I have been waiting on the edge of my seat for this app and I have to say I am extremely disappointed. I thought it would replace DayOne for me, as I’m a person who prefers stock apps to third party. However there is no way I’m leaving DayOne with Journal in its current state. 
First, the app is super basic which I find insane since it took months or even years to develop. It’s basically a blank sheet with minimal options. 
There is no customization…at all. No fonts, markdown, formatting, nothing. It’s basically like the notes app but under a different name. 
There is no way to organize entries - folders, different journals, nothing. I will continue to give it some time but I can’t fathom this replacing any of the third party apps out there. The only perfect is that it’s free…for now 🥴",kelseybrianaaa,2023-10-27T19:51:19-07:00,12,14,1.0,,1698461479
