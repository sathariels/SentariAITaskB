iOS App Store,13093996390,1,Yikes,"Been using this app forever but it’s really taken a turn for the worse with the new redesign. Don’t know why developers insist on making software nearly unusable.
- UPDATE: “will make sense over time” is exactly the sort of thing I’m talking about. When an app is already serving as a fantastic tool to efficiently get things done, making disruptive changes that users have to deal with “until it makes sense” is something people should be fired over. I have over thirteen years of data in this app and use it daily. It seems I’ll need to find an alternative. Or probably just stop keeping track of things because it’s no longer possible to rely on services to do the thing they initially promised to do.

iOS App Store,13081099224,4,Love ... 1 more Ask,"I use this app almost daily . Love multi Journals, prompt reminders, the ability to do audio, vidéo. My mini social media that is just for me! 

More and more i use draw, the scribble does not seem to flow for me. 
So i find myself using the  draw feature as an alternative to scribble journaling, since handwriting recognition isn’t always accurate (multi langual). At times, correcting errors causes me to lose my train of thought, so I end up relying more on the draw option.

However, the current setup is limiting. it only allows drawing on one page at a time, and you have to close out a page before starting a new blank one. That extra step interrupts the creative flow.

Are there any roadmap plans to expand the draw option? For example:

- Making it an infinite canvas
- Allowing smoother continuation to the next page without exiting
- Adding the ability to edit drawing "" writing"" after the fact
- Pasting an image and write over it ect.. like  scratchbook


That make the journaling experience feel much more natural and seamless. For those of us who still want to have that wrting experience but on a device, ty.",LuvAmore,2025-08-30T22:31:23-07:00,0,0,2025.17,,1756618283
iOS App Store,13051936455,3,Handwriting options limited,"I have used this app since 2012. I love it and think it’s perfect in almost every way. However, I stopped using it several months ago when I got a new, large iPad. I’ve found handwriting in the native Notes app with the Apple Pencil Pro to be much more enjoyable. I particularly appreciate being able to hand write using a fountain pen mode. It feels like writing on paper. 

I realize I can use scribble mode in Day One, but it feels clunky dealing with it translating my handwriting into text and correcting the inevitable errors, which becomes irritating. It’s a nice option to have handwriting convert to text, it’s just that I’d rather hand write with the options I’m given in Apple Notes.

I can put my thoughts down so well in Day One and enrich it with media if I feel like it. I set up prompts that help me practice daily gratitude. And the app is always here. Never intrusive.

iOS App Store,13035313785,5,A Great Journal App!,"I really like this app! One of the best things about it is that even the free option has a lot of great features: you can add one picture for free, per journal entry and write pretty much as much as you want in an entry (if there’s a limit I haven’t discovered it yet and I write a lot!). 

I have at least five journals started, including one to keep track of my medical journey. 

I do wish that you could add more pictures per entry, videos, and save audio clips, but I know that the company needs to be able to make money. These are definitely minor inconveniences, especially since there is an option to dictate. It’s not the same as being able to listen to what was said, but is a very handy feature that I appreciate. 

I had a different free journal with the option to save audio recordings and didn’t know that there was a limit to how much data you could save. Once I hit the limit, I could no longer use the app. 

I recently discovered that this journal app has an option to have the journals printed. Yea!!!! You are able to have it printed as a physical book as is or you can make some changes to the cover, etc. 

This option opens up a whole realm of possibilities like creating individual journals to give your children when they are older or even start writing that book you’ve always wanted to write. The pricing seems very reasonable as well. 

I highly recommend this app!",KarinaGrace,2025-08-19T06:20:49-07:00,0,0,2025.16,,1755609649

iOS App Store,13006446896,3,It’s a little obtuse…,"I can ramble on for what seems like forever… but when I get to the meat of the matter, the dictation stops, there’s no doing it other audible indicator that my chatter dice has run out, then if I do anything, it’s unclear if anything I’ve recorded yet, with or without an attachment is findable or stored anywhere in my device,

That said, I sure hire you can create as many journals as you can imagine stream of consciousness discussing topics. If you can remember you have a journal for your district, and where to go reread and subsequently edit for a proper first draft of what could become your book… it’s a great start definitely.

iOS App Store,12901204760,4,Wonderful for memory keeping and on this day memories but could use some improvements,"This app is well worth the premium cost. It replaces social media for memory keeping in a way that can be printed into photo albums but still see videos and live your memories on your phone.

There’s two things that I think could use improvement that would set it apart from its free competitors.

Firstly AI image journal suggestions only go back a few days. Other apps go back a well over a month. I’d prefer it go back even further. This feature is great and really helpful since i primarily use the app to track photo memories with captions so I can see them in the future and print them.

Second the photo album needs some design support. Apps like journi make the album feel more like an album and customizable. Titles and text feel better integrated into the actual design and looks less like a pdf. And backgrounds can be added through themes and pages changed or collaborators can join.

These two enhancements would keep the app in competition and remain up to date. It makes me sad to pay for a lackluster photo book.",Heather Maupin,2025-07-16T21:55:27-07:00,0,0,2025.14,,1752728127

But I recently encountered a devotional that encouraged me to keep a journal as a way of organizing your approach to life. Remember? The other day you were thinking you would…? And on the other hand it can help you keep track of what you have accomplished.

The clutter is back with a vengeance. I kid you not, the interface elements literally take up a THIRD OF THE SCREEN. More if you count the nonsensical “Journal/More” menu at the bottom. It’s *miserable*. Don’t believe me? Look at their own screenshots on this page. And if you flip your phone to horizontal you literally cannot see an entire photo tile. It’s flat out ridiculous. Whoever is in charge of iOS design at Bloom Built needs to be fired. Seriously, when you start the app there are *two* different logo screens that flash by.

iOS App Store,12542620382,1,Great for journaling,"Since the updates, the daily prompts haven’t been updating. 

I have really enjoyed using this app for journaling. I just started actually when Apple came out with their Journal App. The two thing that I like about Apple’s Journal App over this app is that I want to be able to pin more than one location in a journal entry. When we went to Japan, it would have been nice to pin each location we went without having to create a new journal entry. The other thing that I like more in the Apple Journal over this app is that they compile all the attachments in one section. Between videos, photos, and locations, it’s nice that’s it’s all in one “bucket” and then you can look into it from there. The only other thing that I wish - I wish it would support Apple’s Live Photos.

iOS App Store,12245298836,5,Best Personal Development Tool,"For me, journaling is more than just recording thoughts. It’s a time for reflection and review. It’s s a way to uncover the core beliefs that shape our decisions, even when those beliefs aren’t true. Whether helpful or limiting, our beliefs influence our actions, which ultimately shape our results in every area of life

Journaling has been a journey of self-discovery, helping me identify and reframe limiting beliefs while reinforcing the ones that serve me. This practice has improved my health, strengthened my relationships, and sharpened my business decisions.

DayOne makes this process effortless. With customizable templates and voice command on my iPad, I can capture my thoughts every morning in a structured yet personal way. It’s not just a journaling app, it’s a tool for transformation.",Marisa Shadrick,2025-01-29T07:27:37-07:00,0,0,2025.2.1,,1738160857

The UI is intuitive and has a similar feel to the UI Apple notes has (it’s only good feature) but has everything notes doesn’t. The sync feature and the ability to use it on phone or computer, the simplicity of it, the look, the feel— could not give a better review. The free version is absolutely stunning for the value, but the premium version is great especially because of the multiple journals feature. But that’s not even necessary.

iOS App Store,12219352031,5,Life-changing!!,"I’ve been a writer throughout my life, and I’ve kept journals/diaries before, but Day One is such a game-changer! Because of the daily prompts, I’m writing in my journal at least once a day, and that in itself leads to me usually writing more about my day-to-day life. And I love to look back on my entries with “On This Day,” especially to see all the little details that enrich my life that I would’ve forgotten otherwise! All the organizational and multiple journal options are amazing, too! And I especially love the the option to print my journals - because of it, I recently printed some of the stories I’ve written over the past ten years, as a little anniversary present for myself! 😊🥰 Thank you, Day One!! 🩵

It’s easy to jump into a journal and start writing without too many distractions and no pop-ups. So useful in today’s overly attention grabbing design trends. The sync has worked without flaw across devices and I’ve never had an issue even if I’ve taken months away from journaling and let all the apps offload. The price is just right for what it offers (about the price of a year’s worth of decent notebooks to physically journal!) and the payoff of a daily journaling practice far exceeds the cost. Recommend it! Hope they keep the app alive and up to date for a long time to come.,Vimandvigr,2025-01-20T09:20:57-07:00,0,0,2025.2,,1737390057

It’s nice that this app supports all types of media formats so it’s very flexible: audio recordings, videos, photos, scribble, etc and let’s you get your inner most thoughts out. It syncs via iCloud if you have multiple devices. Total worth the investment if you want to go Premium. Support takes a few days to get back to you (better than weeks!) and they update this app so often (almost weekly) you’re guaranteed bug fixes; so if support takes awhile to get back to you, rest assured an almost weekly update will fix it the next time.

No longer are all of my photos accessible to add to entries. And no longer can I synch with my MacBook. I’m done paying for more and more monthly subscriptions. If Apple Journal would import my entries, I’d gladly pay just to get away from an app that changed the rules. Bye bye Day One!

Received a reply from developer explaining pricing. However, no explanation as to why features I originally paid for are no longer available unless I upgrade.
Update 1/7/25:
I reached out to developer as recommended. I received a reply stating that the version I purchased  is no longer supported. So now I understand. The developer was allowed to change the name of the app and no longer support that version and no longer will provide the same features as I had originally purchased unless I pay $35/year.

Negatives: synchronized journals between iOS and OSX are not smooth. Across iOS devices works fine, but because I have a lot of photos in my journals, my OSX jornal will not sync.

This app has a voice to text feature (with the audio saved if I want to keep it) that I use all the time to quickly dictate something into my journal or when I’m on the go. You can also save pictures along with your entries which is a feature I use all the time. And the best part is you can use tags for all your entries. I can’t tell you how many times I pull up all my entries on a particular topic, person, or goal etc. That is one of the pros over a paper journal for me.

The streak incentivizes me to write something, anything. Sometimes I write an entry that just says ""no"", and that's my journal for the day. That's still really useful, because if I notice my entires have been short lately, it usually means there's feelings I'm ignoring, and it's time to check in with myself and break things down. Currently, my streak is over 500, and I am so proud of myself for sticking with it. It's not easy, but it turns out it is, in fact, possible for me to do something every single day, and that alone has made me feel a little better about myself. I can't say this changed my life or anything, I also had a therapist and finally got good meds while I was journaling, but I do think this had a good effect on me too, and the streak and reminders turned out to be key features to keep me going.","Unexpected, but good.",2024-10-01T20:36:23-07:00,0,0,2024.19,,1727840183

Now we have more bugs, notably the landscape view that crashes the app and a hideous interface that looks like a cheap startup designed it because they could afford to hire a pro. I’m a paid customer. Time to start looking for a new service. An attractive interface is a must if I’m using hard earned dollars to pay for a service. Looks like a lot of people aren’t happy with the new interface.

Have been contacted twice by developer regarding review. They continue to ignore the main issue of new design interface. A number of customers have complained about the design issue. They continue to ignore responses. Am looking into new apps.

Now all individual entries look the same, regardless of which journal you are using so easy to mistake one journal for another.

I feel like it defeats the purpose of being able to add custom colors to each journal, which I thought was a fun feature previously. 

Another feature I would love to see would be the ability to add tags to individual photos in addition to the whole entry, or a way to tag people and pets, to make it easier to find specific photos.

I’d like to see a Grammarly based system for auto grammar, spelling and punctuation.  

I’d like to see a suite of dictionaries that cover synonyms, Thesaurus, other languages… and an easy way to call up the one the user needs.

I’d like to see the Underline come back.  

I’d like to see an array of user chosen highlighters from a color wheel.

The book mark is great, and the ability to word search is very good, but I’d like the ability to narrow down the word/quote search in a more refined way.  I usually forget the word that I want to recall.  I also ask myself something like, “When did I write about such and such?” and don’t remember a single descriptive thing about the entry.

I recently had to contact support for help with an issue, and immediately got a response (AI assistant), and when my issue was more complicated (so I thought), got an immediate response from one of their ""Happiness Engineers"".

If a subscription offered me something I needed, I’d buy it, but I don’t need to add more than ten photos or videos to my entries. And I certainly won’t pay just to get support.

— I am able to copy, forward and even create PDFs of my entries when needed - this was a big let down with the apple journal app… I started using that until I realized that you cannot copy or export anything once it is in their app. 
— picture tagging - love that the app automatically goes to the pictures with the same date(s) as the journal entry.  Makes it so simple.
— hashtag capability - makes this easy to organize my journal in a way my mind works
—automatically imports instagram posts (now, we just need it to do the same for facebook - that’s where I posted a lot of my stuff before)

I stated that another good friend has kept a journal since he was a boy. She told me… “It’s never too late to start!”

I started this journal that day, as a way of logging information for my grandchildren when they are older.  

Over the last 900 plus days, I’ve expanded how I use it to log a record of health related items.  I keep adding other things too.  Any time I have something that I think could be noteworthy, I log it.  For example something that might be useful in documentation of a legal matter or whatever.  

Lastly I make sure to log every day.  In addition to keeping track of my weight and exercise I’ve done, I’ve set a goal to actually do something during the day that is noteworthy.   Another way to say that is to make sure I don’t have to disappoint myself by stating that I didn’t do anything today!",K1S2B3,2024-01-31T04:37:30-07:00,0,0,2024.2.2,,1706701050

iOS App Store,10862657418,5,This app is everything!,"OK, I am not a big journal writer, but the Day One app has so many capabilities and is so easy to use that I just love it!

I keep a regular photo journal here where I put time stamped curated photos, and this can be done at the end of each day, or a month later when you have some free time or are home sick or whatever. I also use this to jot down some story about an event or day f I want.

On any given day, I will snap a few pictures of something that brings me joy to include in this journal. I don't need to worry if the photo is 'good' or if anyone else will like it. It is just for me!  When I go back through my phone camera roll, most days have something, and there are fond memories!

This is also great for journalling trips, etc. 

I also keep a private journal (both are private, but this one double-checks before showing any previews on my screen), and this is where I vent, complain, record frustrating experiences, etc. It is so much easier to move on from something if you have documented how it made you feel. This journal helps me move past this, but also allows me to go back and process as needed, and can be a helpful reference for therapy sessions. 

Oh, there is also a email option where I can type an entry into an email that will send directly into my journal. I use this for longer entries.

Unfortunately, there are a lot of drawbacks if you don’t choose the premium plan, which is roughly $36/year. For instance, if you don’t want to splurge on premium, you can not add videos or multiple photos into one entry. It is to be noted that you can add one photo per entry without premium. Also, there is no cross-device sharing without premium. You can’t start on your phone and end on your Mac unless you pay the price.

One of the best features is the location, weather, and activity logging that seamlessly integrate into new entries. When I’m out and about, I take a lot of pictures, but don’t always add them to DayOne the same day. When I create a new entry, I can add the photos and am immediately prompted to apply the photo date and location, so it keeps everything in order.

Its interface is elegantly simple, inviting users to document their thoughts and activities without the distraction of cluttered toolbars.

One of Day One's most compelling features is its versatility. Whether you're a minimalist who appreciates the one-click entry system and clean design or a detail-oriented person who enjoys cataloging entries with metadata like location, weather, and music, Day One caters to all. The app's use of templates and prompts ingeniously lowers the barrier to journaling, making it accessible even when inspiration is scarce.

For those who like to journal on-the-go, Day One's multimedia capabilities allow for a rich recording of experiences, enabling users to add photos, videos, and even audio to their entries. The app also respects the private nature of journaling, offering robust security features to protect personal musings.

Customizable reminders are another innovative aspect, helping users build a consistent journaling habit by setting multiple prompts throughout the day, tailored to their schedule.

Recently I’ve been dealing with trauma recovery and an eating disorder and was looking for something to do 3 times a day “check ins” to stop and recognize what my body feels, emotions etc to recognize they are happening, feel them and allow my nervous system to let the feelings subside in a healthy way. I spent a day looking at different “check in” apps and journals. Thought about just doing little notes in the habits app I use. Or the check in apps where you tap emotions and smiley faces. All dumb and none of the journaling apps really do what Day One does. So I downloaded it again and realized a perfect solution is to pay for premium and have a “daily checkins” journal and a regular one. When I write a long form proper entry I can put it in the journal…the short ones that are just noticing thoughts and feelings (an exercise) I can put in the other. Eventually decided you know I pay $100 for each therapy session and incorporating Day One into my self care routine with all the features is definitely worth $30 a year.

iOS App Store,10020125238,5,I’m Sticking with Day One,"Apple announced that it’ll be introducing its own Journal app with iOS 17. I’m sure it’ll be satisfactory and visually appealing. But like with so many of its apps, I also feel certain that Apple will be slow to add useful features. I love Apple and live entirely with its ecosystem, but they constantly boast new “innovative” features years after third-party apps have already done whatever. 

Reminders vs Things, Notes vs Evernote, Mail vs Spark, Calendar vs Fantastical… Apple is almost always tailing its software competitors. 

Day One is a superb and powerful app that’s accessible on iOS, Mac and the web. I expect Apple’s Journal will take years to catch up to Day One. I journal in Day One currently and have imported my pre-Day One journals dating back to the 60s. I’m committed to Day One, tomorrow & beyond.",RCL2,2023-06-10T12:30:59-07:00,0,0,2023.11,,1686425459

The one qualm I have is about formatting. I often write drafts in other applications, including the iOS Notes app and Google Docs. When I past final versions into here, they lose formatting: any italicization or holding gets stripped away and I have to go through the entire document again. This is frustrating, a rare flaw with Day One. 

It’s also expensive and lacks an option to share with other individual users but remain private otherwise. That feature characterize my original journaling platform, and absent that choice, I have never made Day One my singular choice. It’s far better looking and much easier to use with a well-maintained app, but it still has room to grow to be a 5-star option for journaling.",Miguel Jaime Acero,2023-06-03T07:55:54-07:00,0,0,2023.11,,1685804154

At the end of each trip, I also write a summary at the very top of the page which typically includes what I liked and didn’t like about the trip, what I would do differently, and where I’d go again if I return to the same destination.

iOS App Store,9865985131,4,On the fence,"I have only been using Day One for a few days now and overall I like it, I think. I think it is great how they offer a 1 month trial period for premium, that gives you a lot of time to really figure out all the features and whether it is the right app for you or not. The photos with the location options is a great feature and it is nice to be able to easily reflect back on specific days. My biggest “upset” with the app is that I wish the entries were distinguished differently. I am only using the iPhone version of this app so I cannot speak on any other version, but every entry and day just seems to blend together. The only thing too indicate that entries are from different days is a small date stamp on the right side of the screen. Ideally, I would like to see an option that allows you to only see that days entries and you can toggle left or right to go in between days. I say that as an option because it seems like the majority of users of this app have no complaints about the layout but for those that do, something like that would be a great feature.

IPad and Pencil have opened up the opportunity to have the satisfaction of handwriting with the convenience of a digital format for editing and saving. While I think this app is great so far (I’m just getting started using it), it does not work very well with Apple Pencil. So far I’ve spent more time editing the write-to-text results than actually recording my thoughts/feelings for the day. 

It would be great to have the option to just have pages of handwriting that just stay that way. I’m sure it will be nice to be able to type if I need to make notes on my phone or another device, but when I sit down in the morning with IPad and Pencil, id like to just let things flow instead of having to constantly correct mis-interpreted words.

It’s easy to use, and also as complex as you want to make it (tags, journals, photos, voice recordings, templates...). The location data is key to me because I can get a map view of places I want to visit, or places I have visited.

UPDATE: it’s been super buggy and inconsistent the last 2-3months. Streaks are rarely correct (will say 4 days but show a journal with a 21 day streak, or just show no entries at all despite there being some). Sync between devices is slow, used to be near-instant. The daily prompts are all messed up; sometimes showing an extra prompt in the “show all” list, sometimes I’ll click the day’s prompt and it will auto-fill the entry with yesterday’s.

However when I click on the entry to find where the word appears and what the context was, the keyword is not highlighted, so I have to read carefully through the whole entry to find where the word occurs. This is tedious and not optimal; the keyword should be highlighted so I can quickly find the context for the word that I searched.

I decided not to purchase the app for two reasons: First, the privacy policy on the app is too lenient. This is an app whose purpose is to collect one’s inner thoughts and musings. Tracking location, purchase, and search data is not what I am looking for in these apps. Second, the app is expensive… if this is something that you want to use for several years you are looking at several hundred dollars!

I chose to use an alternative app that is a one-time purchase and limits data storage to iCloud, which I can control.

iOS App Store,9439615361,5,Very impressive but still has trouble uploading video.,"DayOne really has become an impressive journal app, finding all sorts of ways to break down whatever is preventing you from journaling.  It can send you prompts by text, have screen prompts that take you immediately to a blank entry, can record where you’ve been during a day to jog your memory in writing about it.  The interface has also improved, although the back arrow still takes you to the options screen rather than move the cursor back.  After all these advances, it’s a shame that video doesn’t load about half the time.  This has been a known problem for DayOne for months and the resolution should have been implemented weeks ago but video still won’t load.  I have entries from two months ago that still have blank spaces where videos were supposed to have been uploaded.  I no longer recall which videos were supposed to go there since it’s been so long ago.

Maybe it’s the UI, maybe the features, maybe it’s the whole package; there’s just something psychologically satisfying about using it. With my ADHD executive dysfunction, certain apps just don’t sit right because there’s little things that take additional effort: whether it’s having to do an extra step, the entries are a pain to review, or organization is not as easy.

If you have poor and hazy memory like me, the Premium subscription is  100% worth it to have a solid timeline that contains your thoughts, emotions, intentions, concepts, ideas, brainstorming/brain-dumps, pictures, videos, links, and whatever else all packaged into one app available across your devices.

Journaling is cathartic, helps you figure out where you’re at, helps you process your emotions, and gives you a history of your life that you can review at anytime.

However, DayOne allows you to have your journal with you at all times, because it is an app on your phone/iPad. It is so much easier to just grab your phone/ipad instead of reaching for a physical journal and pen all the time. I especially love the media feature where you can add pictures or videos about your day - that right there makes it so much better than using a regular notebook. 

I am so excited to have all of these memories with me. Best part is that day one journal also can provide an extra layer of security by prompting you to use FaceID/password. Thats pretty cool! I also love the different prompts that you can use. I have it set up where i do prompts in the morning and in the evening I have a second journal to reflect on my day.

Once you upgraded to the paid version, you were able to access all the extra features. Now I am unable to use most of what I paid for years ago. How is this in any way fair? Those of us who supported Day One by purchasing the paid version should get their money’s worth, should they not? What a waste of money.

The features have come a long way, but the baseline features have remained. A clean and beautiful place to type whatever is on my mind, and the ability to look back through time. 

As the features have become more refined, so do those looks back. But so do also the ways I use the app. 

I don’t use every single feature, but as a songwriter the audio record feature has made Day One my only songwriting tool. 

The only thought I’ve just had is the ability to create “versions,” as with songwriting I often copy past entries so I don’t lose past ideas. 

But as this is mainly a journaling style app, I can’t see where else would bring the beauty and the features like DayOne does. 

I really appreciate going back to roots by making a text entry a one-click experience, but I also value the newer features like Photo, Location, and Calendar integration.

The journal icon is even a pen writing on paper and yet you can’t actually do that. Part of journaling isn’t just putting down you thoughts but the little doodles and nonsense that come with it.

I understand there is a “Draw” option that lets your use Apple Pencil but it just saves whatever you put there as a picture within the journal entry, it’s not the same.

My favorite features are “on this day” and tag entries, so you don’t have to have multiple journals of different topics, you can just sort down to the category using a tag. Also great when you just want to reread your favorite memories of people by tagging them. 

I think my only suggestion for improvement is allowing more freedom with photo structure.

This app makes it so easy! You can add a photo, respond to a daily prompt, complete a daily summary or just free write. 

The some nice things about this app-
you can search for old posts by using key words, there is a search bar. So you could use it reflect on how much you write about a person or situation or to locate a special entry. 
It records your streaks which can help to keep you going when forming the habit of journaling. 
It also shows old entries from that day in past years.  So now that I have been doing it for two years on any given day I can see what I wrote the previous year and sometimes from two years ago that day which is really cool to reflect on. 
I know a lot of people use social media as a way to record their life but this is just yours and for me that is special. The only intended audience is your future self which is very different than social media.

I've used this app for so long and seen it grow that even the small gripes, I know, will be fixed eventually.. I journaled in DayOne immediately after my kids were born. Their weight, time of birth, a picture. I go back and read those posts all the time. Thank you very much for this app. 

Feature request: We really need an update on the share card settings. I love using the share card to share my “on this day” posts, but there’s no date. Just a dayone logo and weather. Why weather? lol It’s just a strange choice especially since I’m sharing from the “on this day” section of the app.",Mr. Ekted,2022-08-21T12:10:05-07:00,0,0,7.13,,1661109005

This journal started as a way to ‘talk’ to him and deal with my grief and loss. I add a photo and quote a day and have done that almost every day from the beginning. Lately I also write a few sentences of what I’m grateful for. I use it when I’m happy and when I’m sad or when I want to vent. I rarely miss a day. To date I have well over 2,769 entries. I often read back to see how I was feeling in the past. This helps me see progress and life changes. Writing in Day One has become the way I start my day. I did buy the premium so I can add multiple photos and short videos. Yes I am more centered and sane using this app. Thank you.",Enufwiththenicknams,2022-08-12T06:29:24-07:00,0,0,7.13,,1660310964
iOS App Store,8936947620,5,The power of journaling!,"I’ve been using DayOne as my private journal for the last 3+ years.  I started using it when I realized I was never doing the journaling I wanted to do because 1.) writing on paper meant leaving it around the house for prying eyes, and 2.) I never had my journal on me when I had something to say.  Keeping my journal with its own password on my phone means I can jot down my thoughts anywhere - on the train, in the bathroom, sitting next to a family member, in the middle of the night in the dark, etc.  It has allowed me to explore my brain and change my world view.  

I love the photo journaling aspects and that I can see what I was thinking a year ago, 2 years ago, etc. It has become my own personal ‘Facebook’ memory. I have a file for recipes and food ideas, too.  

DayOne is an integral part of my life now.  I recommend it to friends, family, and my patients.  Thank you!!",Dr Bags,2022-08-02T03:36:15-07:00,0,0,7.12,,1659436575

I do these sessions through talking in the audio box. I feel like every time I get to a really mind blowing point in my audio session it cuts off a big chunk of the audio clip and if i’m not paying attention, the clip won’t record everything i say past a certain point.

I really love Day One, but I really would encourage you guys to fix the bug with the audio cutting off randomly.

I would like to some day listen back to my old audio clips and reminisce on problems I faced throughout my life and when the audio cuts off part of what i’m saying…i essentially have to restate everything that i gave an in-depth explanation on, in a more simplified way through the text feature or if i have the patience, the audio feature.

I think the bug starts when I get a notification or I shake my phone and the push notifications pops up about if I want to “undo” and usually this happens when i’m not paying attention. I think this is where the recording stops and then it’ll still act like it’s recording, but it really isn’t. Please can you guys fix this!!

I’ve been wrestling with this since I first started my account, and I kept thinking you would work out the bugs, but honestly it’s like it keeps getting worse. It feels like your AI is getting dumber. It regularly changes correct words to incorrect ones, it misses obvious corrections, it suggests completely random words that have nothing to do with the letters I typed. and it has never learned any of my family’s names - never offers correct spellings as suggestions, never seems to have noticed that those are words I use constantly. I’m a busy mom and business owner, and I’ve just had to live with it because I don’t have time to clean everything up.

I also love being able to record from my Apple Watch and having it upload straight into the app. 

One suggestion to the dev team: 
- please improve the transcription equation! It does a deplorable job at getting the words right. The whole point of this feature to me is that sometimes you don’t want to be listening to a long audio(of your own voice, but nonetheless) and would rather read a transcription that hopefully doesn’t have so many weird errors in it that you feel inclined to fix. Because then what’s the whole point of transcription when you could’ve just spent that time+energy writing the entry in the first place?

In the beginning there were a few gaps where I tried out different journals because I’m always looking for the next best thing but this is it.

- the search feature allows me to find events with specific friends, photos of construction phases (like looking up “underground” allows me to see where I buried conduits 2 years ago), when I bought a keg (to see how long it lasted), how much vacation time I have taken, how long I owned a car, etc.
- having attached photos and videos makes the journal so much better than paper.
- I use it daily now that I am digital. I was hit and miss before.
- the “on this day” feature is very cool to look back at what you did at this time in previous years.
- the import of Instagram posts is great too. I quit social media but it retained all of my posts in Day One going 8 years back to when I opened my Instagram account.
- the prompt questions are interesting ways to draw out ideas you may not journal about.

The tagging and search functions are immensely valuable and make organizing and recalling information very easy. 

The only reason I don’t give 5 stars is that, for the price, there are some basic functionalities that I think the app needs. For one, Windows capability. It’s extremely frustrating to find a good recipe on my work computer but not be able to put it directly into my Day One App. 

Second, the inability to edit written entries (like with an Apple Pencil) after you submit them, plus the lack of good templates, feels like an easy fix. GoodNotes provides these functionalities for a fraction of the price (but without the organization offered by Day One).

I never really stressed about journaling daily, i just did it when I felt like this is a memory I should always keep. I just ordered a print with hard cover of all my 250+ entries and let me tell you …

It great! The quality is awesome specially the hardcover is amazing to the touch! I love how it shows on the map the cities you have been to! I love how it lets you customize cover but not overwhelming amount of options. I like the stats on the back it shows how many cities I have been to how many entries etc. and a lot more!

Wish list:
1. I had songs attached to some entries which I wish would have been printed (just the name and the artist name) 

2. I wish the video attachments let me choose which frame to choose for the thumbnail (for printing it just uses first frame)

3. I wish there was an auto counter for each entry (i do this manually rn but it would be nice to have)

I love Day One and I use Premium which is worth it. I created a template for a daily journal which has become a mixture of habit tracking (using the checklist feature), voice recordings for reflection, pictures to capture memories or lessons, and actual written highlights and reflections of my day. I have found a way to use Day One that creates a powerful tool not just for capturing memories, but creating growth experiences and tracking my personal growth journey. I look back at old posts (On This Day) from 1, 2, or 3 years ago and am amazed with how far I've come, and by keeping track of what I've learned, I can reread it and remember to apply them over and over. Day One is so customizable as a journal, and you can even create multiple journals too with Premium if you want to separate your entries. I've recently started going through and taking notes on some of my audio lessons/recordings since Day One also makes it easy to keyword search what you're looking for, which is way faster than going through hours of audio lessons. The tag feature is also helpful here.

iOS App Store,8503048361,5,A Gateway to Reality,"I have always wanted to journal, but the inconvenience of having the small book, an appropriate pen, and the physical circumstances seemed to prevent me from doing so. As I have an iPhone, iPad, and a MacBook Pro, and have one of those readily available just about all the time, journaling becomes practice. The two missing elements are a busy life and moments I want to capture that are sufficiently stirring that they will make me want to record the event. Day One reminds me each day to journal (Important!) and allows me to take a photo either in Photos or right from the app. The combination inspires me to write about what I have photographed. I have been frustrated with photo apps in that they are not focused on a written description of what was going on a the moment the image was captured. Day One solves that. Perhaps the greatest benefit of Day One is that I can easily see and read (unlike my handwriting in awkward places and in a small journaling book) what I have written in the past. The ""me"" that is revealed in my writing is a different ""me"" than the one I perceive in my mind's eye. Writing is, as others have noted, a window into the soul and a reflection of reality.

The automatic time/date/weather/location date it puts in and how if I forget to journal an event and days later I go back to do so, it remembers those facts and asks if I would like to attach them! Of course! It’s neat looking back at entries and seeing the weather, location and time. Gives more depth to the memory. 
2. A Mac App!! For longer journal entries or more reflective entries, I always prefer to type on a computer and I love that they have a desktop version that syncs so fluidly with my ios one. 
 3. Multiple Journals and tags! I love sorting my journals! Tags are nice to sort but the addition of being able to tag AND have other journals is great! 
4. Can include movies and photos
5. Can print journals into a book
6. On this day feature showing memories on this day
7. Templates! Makes routine logging convenient  and consistent.
8. Calendar integration
9. Password safe
10. BEST JOURNALING APP! Pay the subscription fee! It’s worth it because it supports all the awesome work they do! Besides, a physical journal would cost money too and wouldn’t be half as wonderful. 

They really do a great job at maintaining this app and they have done a phenomenal job creating it! Love it!",Cpprboom,2022-03-26T18:42:02-07:00,0,0,7.3,,1648345322

There’s one thing that needs to be updated its struggles with and that’s a Videos so they added a new feature where you can record up to four minute videosIf you do it through the app crashes but you can still post videos from your gallery and it takes a long time to sync or show the video sometimes and this needs to be fixed.

iOS App Store,8472919713,5,Can an App Change Your Life?  — Yes!,"Most of the apps we use provide information/entertainment, help us do things faster, or allow us to share with others.  DayOne is not just a journalling app, not just a way to put thoughts and words on a piece of “digital paper”.  No, DayOne provides an simple, clean environment to reflect on our lives, document the happy moments, express the angry frustrating ones, and help organize our life’s activities.  

The elegant design, clean interface, and robust features enable me to declutter and unstress each and every day. I look forward to opening DayOne and seeing my past entries and a prompt to write more.  Clicking the “+” to add a new entry opens my mind and heart to share myself.  As I begin to write, the keyboard shortcuts allow me to stay focused on my thoughts instead of searching for menus and commands.  I use tags on every entry to help organize and group like writings.  Finally, the ability to add media in any area of my journal page creates a wonderful professional looking product.  All of these features allow me to focus on the writing and more importantly to put my life’s activities and emotions into perspective.

iOS App Store,8456240121,5,Would Love an Accurate Word Search,"Some search functions in other programs will show the exact location of each and every occurrence of a word entered in the search bar. Day One’s search will take you to the page only, so if the page is, say, for passwords (and I have multiple hundreds of them), I’ll find myself scrolling forever. And if I accidentally touch the screen I can just forget it, it will take me all the way back to the beginning, and I’m pulling my hair out by that time. I’ve been using this program for years and I’m a fan. Even share it / recommend it often. I’ve given it 4 stars here because of the inadequate search function but just know that I’ll not only pump it to 5 stars, but will pay well for an upgrade if Day One developers would install a solid global search engine. In the meantime, thank you much for you work, and your commitment to a wonderful app. David Sovereign, Filmmaker

What they can do better: I do wish they was a better form of communication than just email but they claim there was a hiccup in the system and that’s what causes the week+ delay. Understandable. Things happen.

Using Day one is like creating a back up of your day to day life and happenings.  It’s one of the most intuitive and feature rich applications that I have ever used.  I don’t know how I managed before without this app.  I think the only way they could improve it for me is to add the ability to write a journal entry using a range of dates or even just allow you to group a span of days.  I use it for trips and would love to be able to group the days for a particular trip or event.  Sort of like a trip report or event report.  That would come in handy for printing a little trip journal or event journal.  Customer service is fantastic.  It’s just a great app.",lesfstl,2022-03-04T06:04:31-07:00,0,0,7.1,,1646399071

        I hope that more people can learn about this app, and maybe have it help them like it did for me. It’s simple to use, although everything has its issues; it can’t be perfect, because everyone has their own likes and dislikes. Try it out if you need a place to just write. 
       In other apps I’ve tried, it would remind me to journal everyday, but this app doesn’t (as far as I know). It made me feel better that I wasn’t writing in it everyday.

I don’t have to decide which journal should this note be in, I can just write and decide later, without it getting lost.
Very thoughtful design. Easy to capture thoughts and ideas; easy to find them when I want to follow up on them.
The only possible thing I can think of to add would be the ability to make covers for my journals.

I can keep things organized and can easily look anything up by using keywords. I love how you can make lists, bullet points, or even just save something I saw on Pinterest. It’s easier than taking screenshots that I’ll never come across bc I take so many so this way, I can take a screenshot and save it in my Journal under the right category where I’ll be more likely to find certain items. I love that it’s extremely private and you can color coordinate each different Journal. I’d rather call it my sidekick for when I need ideas or use it to keep documents safe, esp with the end-to-end encryption. 

I had Pocket too, which is also a great app but it wasn’t as easy to navigate than this app. Finally I quit Pocket and stuck to Journal. Guess it depends on the type of person 🤷🏼‍♀️",M. A. Wright,2022-02-09T17:20:51-07:00,0,0,6.15.1,,1644452451

This stressed me out after having spent 30+ minutes reflecting on something important. It eventually let me save and since then I haven’t had any issues. I also really like the calendar view of my photo/journal entries.

iOS App Store,8268300538,4,Seems great but one request,"Found this app today and was really excited to use it with my partner until I realized there was no simple collaboration feature. 

Right now we use SimpleNote, and although they do not have much in terms of designing the entry more creatively like this app, the one thing they do have, the most important for us, is the collab feature. We do a ton of self-growth work and like to share our notes with each other, adding to them or just simply reading them and feeling connected when apart. Why that feature is so convenient on theirs is because you simply click “collab” in the drop down menu of each entry, add someone’s email address, it sends them an email a note was shared, but then the entry pops up under their app too. No need to edit/collab via that email, because you can collab straight from the app. Any collab entries just show up like they are your entries on your app. It’s so convenient and helpful. 

I really would love to see this app bringing something easy like that to it, because it already has everything we could ask for in journaling, but this one majorly important thing. Aside from this, amazing job developers!",TwisterClatterClash,2022-01-21T21:46:58-07:00,1,2,6.15.1,,1642826818

Then I needed more!  I needed to record impact stories from our camp and retreat center.  I needed to capture article and white paper ideas.  I needed to keep a journal on the maintenance for my vehicles.

iOS App Store,8216080450,1,Too convoluted,"A journal is supposed to be simple, however this app is not. Sadly, it never has been. I originally bought the app on my MacBook a decade ago, fast forward to today and its almost exactly the same on my iPhone. The moment you open it, you are greeted by an interface that makes no sense. The default notepad on my iPhone is more user friendly than this. The whole point to a journal is mostly to jot your thoughts down, perhaps a photo; that is not the case with this app. I would go as far as to say that it’s discouraging to use because you just want to type your thoughts into a notebook and have it be chronological. You can’t do that with Day One. They want you to create a journal for every category of your life. That’s not journalling, that’s compartmentalizing your life. Twitter is more useful as a journal than this is. Not to mention, but I bought the app on my MacBook and now they want me to pay annually just to sync everything. What’s funny about that is I only ever had two entries before I stopped using it. So to pay just for syncing can’t be justified, instead it’s insulting.

I’m now retired and can spend my days thinking ancient history, religion, and philosophy.  As I’ve used Day One, I’ve created journals on major themes.  But then, I can imbed photos into Naturalism entries, imbed PDF documents for reference into Science or Politics entries, and track what I have found and the new questions that arise.

I’ve taken all my old digital journal entries and transferred to dates that I can use to recreate my own history, my thoughts and significant events.  I’m now in the process of entering all my paper journals.

Then you can click back out and keep writing. 

Almost every other journaling app will let you glance down as you write and see how many words you have written. And a good many number of journal apps let you set word count goals — and have some kind of little graphic showing you how close you are to that goal. Day One does neither - as basic as that is. 

I thought, “Surely I am not seeing an option or doing something correctly.” I contacted their support team and the answer was that it is a feature they are considering for the future. For now you have to stop writing…click click click and scroll down in menus - get your word count…and then you can keep writing.

 So if you want, simply, on a most basic level, to know how many words you have written as you write…this is not the app for you.

I can add videos and pictures. It documents what the weather was like as I did my entry. It can also keep an exercise journal, which I have yet to explore. I like how this company is focused on allowing giving people the tools necessary to document who they truly are. I deleted my Facebook account because I hate how it has pushed so many people to forget about their true genuine selves in documenting their lives. I gave four stars because I don’t like that I have to go back and add punctuation for everything that was transcribed. If speech-to-text can punctuate, this should be able to punctuate too.",Cassoke,2021-11-27T12:52:41-07:00,0,0,6.13,,1638042761
iOS App Store,8034791913,5,Day One Review 5 STARS,"I've been attempting to keep a journal since high school. The longest effort lasted less than a week which was about three descriptions of personal events. With Day One I've made over years worth of entries. This is a great tool. My writing has improved and I'm using it for much more than a ""Dear Diary"" record. I use D1 to compose letters to family and friends, log events, track personal exercise, make to-do lists, record favorite recipes, plus many more things that I wouldn't have kept in other journals including photos, heirlooms, travel snapshots, sketches, maps and more. Thank you! Day One you make it easy and fun.

Day One has also served well to backtrack events as mundane as service records for appliances, autos and electronic equipment. It has saved the day a few times. Thank you!",zeako,2021-11-17T14:00:50-07:00,0,0,6.12,,1637182850
iOS App Store,8024299889,5,Wow - what a powerful app!,"I used to have a paper planner that I used to track what I did all day.  This is so much more powerful than that. It's almost like having a scribe follow-you and make a journal of your day.

Using IFTTT, I create a journal entry automatically when my phone sees I enter or leave work. Or home.  Or the gym.  

When my garage door opens, I set it up to create a journal entry. Or when someone approaches my Ring Doorbell.

I can set up a text so I can quickly make a journal entry just by sending a text.

At times through the day, it prompts me to answer questions like what I want to accomplish or what I learned that day.  

I also set it up to add a photo whenever I take one with my phone, and to make a post of the top news stories of the day so I can look back later.

Truly - this is an amazing, customizable app.  You just need to spend some time being creative in how you want to use it.",Conservative Ranter,2021-11-14T11:57:44-07:00,1,1,6.12,,1636916264
iOS App Store,8020596346,5,Exceptional!,"Keeping a journal was necessary, explained our counselor. My wife had just been diagnosed with dementia several decades earlier than most… The counselor explained that daily logging would be therapeutic, it would clarify past events and it would give us guide posts of the diseases’ progression. 

But, in the course of daily journal-keeping, I started to enjoy the simple interface of DayOne. You can also import photos taken just the day before. With Instapaper, articles that you found indispensable can be tied to the day the day that you read them. 

Facebook, Instagram, WeatherUnderground, Google and PDFs work seamlessly with DayOne creating a five-star, near perfect journaling program that would satisfy the most rigorous psychiatrist or the newest-and most naive journal writers.",dgsbodeisverige,2021-11-13T11:33:53-07:00,0,0,6.12,,1636828433
iOS App Store,8014296942,5,A blessing disgusted as an app,"I love to write, as an over-thinker and someone who ruminates on things a lot it’s something very therapeutic. It’s nice to write down a reflection of how your day was, a good or bad moment of your day, something that triggered you, someone that hurt you or about the past. Oh the past! I could write for days. What’s really great about this app is that it has a feature where you can create a passcode for the app or even choose to unlock it with your Face ID like your phone. I’ve tried other apps that don’t have that, or they do have it but you have to upgrade to premium for it but not this one. As a kid I grew up with very strict people around me, and privacy was something I didn’t have most of the time, I’m now 18 and have a cellphone that I bought and pay each month, so there’s that just for reference. I always wanted to start journaling but because of the lack of privacy I help myself back but this has helped me a lot, I feel safe I feel that my thoughts are safe and that I can express myself and actually write what I want to write about my life. The cool thing is you can also add pictures and audio notes, it keeps track of how many days in a row you’ve journaled to keep you motivated and to keep a streak going. 10/10 for me. I hope to learn to process my thoughts and emotions through journaling to then be able to learn and be more aware of myself, heal and grow as a person.

Being able to add pictures in is a sweet touch to be able to make each day unique and memorable when needed! I’ve also enjoyed the ‘template’ option for more focused journaling for different seasons of life! And I enjoy being able to have multiple journal types if I like to. I definitely like to organize my thoughts into categories or have a safe space to write my thoughts out on a specific subject where it is held all in one place and not mixed up in my day-to-day journaling.  I wish there were more font or formatting options just to be able to create more emotion on the page or to be more creative with but that is not a deal breaker for me!

I think it does a reasonable job with scribble…however it could be better. One issue I’m finding is that it won’t allow me to scroll up on a page to give me room to write, so when I’m on a flow of an idea & suddenly I have no ‘paper’ left it is an issue. I just think the same area that the keyboard would take up & cover on the screen if I was using that function should be available if using the Pencil. Also I think one needs a better mechanism to bring up controls like undo & copy/paste etc in ‘scribble’ mode. Other than those issues I’m enjoying using the app as my daily journal.",Bellrevue,2021-10-19T19:11:29-07:00,1,1,6.10.1,,1634695889

While some of the other apps were definitely decent, Day One has my I vote for the best one yet! I love its simplicity despite the many great features it provides. The only difficulty I've had with it is when I bought a MacBook and downloaded the Mac Day One app and then tried to bring over my 2 years worth of entries from my iPad version. They're two different versions, so a simple synch doesn't work. Despite very prompt and thorough tech support from Day One, I still haven't managed to bring over my old entries. But, that's not a problem with the app itself, so I even hesitate to risk dampening the enthusiasm of my recommendation by mentioning it :) Do try it and see if it's not the very app you've been looking for! I should add that now, with the new version, I can journal on my iPhone, iPad or MacBook and they all synch seamlessly. LOVE IT!",Poincicco,2021-10-17T05:26:18-07:00,0,0,6.10.1,,1634473578

iOS App Store,7865956998,5,Needs great UX/UI,"hi guys, thanks for improving the app.. but i wanna point out some things. Make timeline page have a customizable ‘action’ button, because i wanted to just click once to pull a video and start recording me talking for 30 mins about my life. Currently there are photos, audio and text. Make it customizable. This will be very helpful to truckers, delivery drivers that works alone but don’t want to fiddle a lot of buttons just to record. And second, after recording a video, can you label the ‘input title’ field with ‘write your title’, because right now, there’s only blank which confuses the user to navigate the title field. Also the timeline, it’s way too cramped especially the bottom part where you’ll see the time of the audio, address and weather, can you put a separator between them, cause right now they are just connected in one line, makes the UI jarring to read. also for audio clips, put an icon on the right hand side, and maybe put the length of the audio overlaying the icon. instead of cramping it at the bottom of the journal entry in the timeline view.. make it look beatiful and simple, easy to navigate.. but i really love what youre trying to do, its the best journal app there is… i would love to subscribe if these features are available… theres more that i would love to input but its getting too long.

The app reminds me toward the end of the day, or anytime I set it to, that it’s time to journal. At the end of the day I can just talk to it and it records my words. I don’t have to go far to find my journal, wonder where it is, find a good pen, or any other distraction. I can just respond to the reminder and quickly jot down what I want to remember from that day. Plus add photos (if I thought to take any that day.)

iOS App Store,7840560621,3,Writing prompts,"I got the app mostly for the daily writing prompts.  I already journal and have for years, but my journal entries are often short reports of what happened today.

I am retiring soon and hope to do much more writing.  I write for a living but again, very specific topics and audience, whereas what I hope to write is more of a memoir.   My writer friends tell me they write for 30 minutes a day, but most belong to a group with a leader who supplies a writing prompt daily.  I was hoping for that.   Some days it is that.  But way too many days it’s things like “come up with a crazy business idea” or “What were your 5 favorite movies.”   Luckily, I have the free version so I can’t complain too much.  But I would love it if the daily prompts could be less specific and more like open ended statements or questions that provoke thought.

I also am not a fan of the writing streak function, which only records whether I have written in response to the prompt but not if I have done other journal writing on that day.  I think it would be more accurate (and less annoying) if it counted any writing done on a particular day as part of the writing streak.",Rvmpt,2021-09-24T08:34:50-07:00,0,0,6.9.1,,1632497690

The design of the app is pretty slick but it's all too complicated. Many advanced features, multiple journals, complex text formatting, etc. It's impressive that they were able to add all this over the years, but for me wanting just to write down my thoughts, I sometimes get lost in the navigation or can't find a button that's hidden behind another button. I long for the simplicity of an app like Apple Notes.

iOS App Store,7817548651,5,Best journaling app ever,"I seriously love this app so much. I have been using it for about ten years now, around the time it was first introduced. No other journal app compares, and honestly I love this app so much that once I started using it years ago, I never even tried searching for another journal app. This is always gonna be the one for me so I hope you stick around for the long haul! ☺️

I have written in it daily for almost 450 consecutive days. Some days I spend 2-3 hours hammering away at my keyboard, typing up my thoughts and memories of the day. Other days I write small highlights. My new habit has changed my life! I recommend keeping a daily journal to everybody. 

Day One makes it super easy to organize your thoughts, memories, photos, etc into beautiful journals. I love how you can type on any device and it’ll sync, and create multiple journals with their own color label. It’s easy to find entries on the calendar or by searching. The Premium subscription is worth every penny! You won’t regret it. 

I’ll always be a fan!!! Thanks for all your amazing and hard work with this app. It’s seriously my favorite!!

I had an issue a while back and their devs replied right away and helped me resolve it so quickly and easily.

In my paper journal I would only write a page and stop, or maybe two. I mentally felt pressure to fill up a page. With this, there is no end to a page and I love that.

My only wish is that you didn’t have to pay for a second journal. I would love to have one that wasn’t my day to day but oh well. Over all it is very good.

You can enter text, photos, videos, voice recordings, import your calendar and create notes from your calendar events, submit entries vis text.

For a couple of dollars a month, you can sync between your iPhone and iPad and have multiple journals. One cautionary note: you cannot access your journal on a Windows PC. Desktop integration is only available with a Mac. In my opinion, this is a significant omission. I found Internet “rumors” that there would be a PC app available but they are a few years old so apparently one isn’t coming.

iOS App Store,7630362832,5,Very easy to use for basic journaling (can’t vouch for other features ),"This makes it easy to just write a little bit about my day. Sometimes I would do the same thing in my Notes app, but somehow this feels much better, since it’s not mixed in with shopping lists, other thoughts, and other random notes that are in there. Somehow just having a separate app for it makes it a little more approachable. I can’t say it suddenly make me a daily journal-keeper, but I’m not sure how many entries, if any, I would have written in the past 3 months if not for this app. I think I have 5-6.

I’ve just used the text, but I really like that I can add a picture if I want to. I don’t know how many other features are available without paying, but I would say if you’re on the fence, you should get the app and put the icon in a place on your phone where it’s not necessarily in the way, but where you will see it.

Fourth, the dictation tool is fantastic—it records your voice and automatically transcribes the text. As a heavy Dragon user, I can say it is not as accurate as a trained Dragon profile, but it is really, really accurate. It seems to work better for me than the Drafts dictation tool. Fifth, you can upload PDFs and other media to entries. Last, I love having the widget on my Apple Watch where I can dictate into my watch, it really removes friction from the journaling task.

Formatting can be customized to a large degree but I would appreciate more latitude in creativity with headings and lists. This hasn’t significantly impaired my enjoyment of the app and the dev team has done an excellent job supporting and updating it over time. DayOne is one of my most highly utilized and favorite apps.

iOS App Store,7466149917,5,So close.,"I’ve logged hundreds of entries in Day One. I love it. But still, after so much time there are problems. One click has wiped some of my journals, which is due to the poor execution of the ‘merge’ feature, and the book printing and shipping has been less than stellar. I’ve been waiting months for my book to arrive, after they already lost one in the mail and took a long time to handle it. Customer service has done what they can, but it hasn’t quite cut it. On top of that, the book printing options aren’t great either. The paper, cover, and colors are limited, and force a rather obnoxious aesthetic. If a journal is meant to last a long time, I’d expect the options, quality, and choices to be robust. 

Look. It’s a decent app. But when it comes to journals it needs to be better than decent. Handling personal information, sometimes massive amounts, needs to be handled well.",lemonkeymec,2021-06-14T21:52:04-07:00,0,0,6.4,,1623732724

The latest update, which was pushed this morning, has destroyed the visuals. All of my journals are now dominated by three or four large words of text, with some tiny pictures to the right.

What was a central part of my day, journaling in Day One as the day went along, well, I’m going to have to find something else and I’m pretty crushed about it. 

Nevertheless, this is a robust, easy to use app with very nice people behind it. If you don’t care that the end result is now ugly, you may like it.

iOS App Store,7271248036,3,Bugs and Improvement Suggestion,"Overall I like this app’s features and record-keeping but the more I use it, the more several features and bugs keep this from being perfect.

One - almost every time I add a specific location and/or Tag and I save the entry, I go back and find the either the location name doesn’t save, or one or more tags disappear and I would have to redo them. Can this be fixed so that the information I input would save and stay the first time?

Two - The map feature is quite annoying. When I’m searching for a specific location name (should be near the top since I’m standing right in front of it), sometimes the name won’t come up and when I search for it, the first options would be somewhere far away. Also, I’m unable to expand the map to a bigger range on my screen. Instead, the map would only be in the upper half of my phone and it’s very hard to navigate to the specific location I’m looking for.

Beyond that, it’s helped me to see a picture of my overall mental health year by year and identify things I struggle with over and over.

Day One has been a near-perfect companion for the last several years. The product is both easy and fun to use and it’s rare that I think of something I want but don’t have.

I don’t use Instagram, but for those who do the ability to automatically populate your journal from your Instagram account looks very powerful.  My favorite feature is how, each day at the time I choose, it reminds me that “on this day” I have prior year journal entries.

Yes, you can make more than 1 journal under my $35 purchase I made for myself (mine & hers). However, there is NO privacy and you can easily view each other’s journals. You CANNOT password protect individual journals if you share the same account.

Everything else is extremely good though and nice to have digitized to quickly skim through and see one’s progress. 

For myself writing is starting to show its value since one can quantify all the work one has put into something over time. It helps psychologically quite a bit, particularly when others don’t quite give you the support needed to go through your adventure, annotating it to later share with new friends and/or to throw it in the face of those that doubted you through the hard times helps to not completely give up on the progress/dream.

So I re-downloaded the app and gave it a try.  YES, you can write a journal entry with an Apple Pencil instead of typing if you click the paper clip attachment icon and pick Drawing.  So, I updated my review to 5 stars.  This is the best app for journaling ever.  I use my Apple Pencil with my iPad.  I like using my phone too.  I appreciate the developer response!

Edit Again:  OK, I have been burned too many times by apps.  I am going back to paper and pen.

Now you need to tap the map at the bottom, then “Location”, then open on Day One, then edit location and THEN select the name of the place you are.

Day One makes it easy to journal in a meaningful way that a traditional journal has a problem. I can choose the form of my journal with pictures and videos, sound clips, or writing. Having the ability to create different journals around different ideas is also very helpful. I find it easier for me to track my health, emotions and thoughts, and exciting events that pop up in the day with the different formats.

iOS App Store,6628661964,5,Day One has come a long way!,"I have been using Day One for about 4 years now. I have always kept a journal since I was a kid but I wanted something password protected to use on my MacBook. When I first started using the Day One, it was limited and the phone app was incredibly buggy especially on iPhone. Over the years the developers have absolutely refined Day One into one of the best apps you can invest in on the App Store. I truly enjoy looking back over the years to see how far I have come. 

I mainly use this app as a “mind dump” whenever I feel overwhelmed and to record my dreams. Over time it has expanded into several different journals. I’m just now starting to use it to record smaller and simpler thoughts throughout the day to replace social media and it’s doing wonders for my mental health. Since it’s much more stable and reliable on iPhone it’s been a joy to use on-the-go. We all have those thoughts we just want to get out and social media isn’t always the place for that. Day One is a perfect judge-free zone where I won’t look back on a post 5 years later and feel deep regret for making that thought public. 

I did try out Day One Premium for 1 year because I wanted to use the video feature. I could only record a couple of minutes at a time and I didn’t end up using it as much as I thought I would. I didn’t use any of the other features in that year so I ended up reverting back to the basic package, but I’m sure those extra features will be useful for others!",Dejasmiles,2020-11-10T00:29:38-07:00,180,259,5.6,,1604993378

I had the previous version that I downloaded from “starbucks app of the day” and then didn’t use it for a while in which time they had changed the entire interface and upgraded it to what it is today. Sadly I forgot my password for the first version and had no way of retrieving the entries.  However I started this and glad they have back up options and so on. Anyways it’s been a great tool helping me through bright and dark days . 
The only thing I would ask of the Dev team is optimize syncing across devices, especially with notifications . I use my Mac to journal most of the time and when I do finish , I still get notification on my watch to “record my day” . Also the pop up mini reminder screen that comes up on the Mac to start an entry is a hit or miss with starting on the mini screen in which case I have to click “open” for the larger interface.

1) I wish there was a windows application. I would love to be able to write on my windows machine. There have been times where inspiration strikes but I’m on my windows machine, which means content switching and going to a different device. It’s not a deal breaker but it sure is annoying. 
2) I wish you could edit the photo sizes in the photo books before printing. Some pages end up being a photo with one line of text then almost an entire blank page. It ends up printing many nearly blank pages. So I wish I could edit those photo sizes to save on pages.

I also enjoy the metadata tagged in each entry (location, weather, activity, etc) which I feel will be very interesting in the long run as I review older entries.

My biggest ask is that I very much wish the developer would make the journaling canvas more free form by allowing entries to contain mixtures of text, handwriting, photos, and drawings similar to how iPadOS notes works. As it functions at the time of this review the entry is more like an e-mail composer where you enter text, and then can attach photos and drawings in a somewhat rigid manner.

iOS App Store,6209661435,1,This app needs a serious update,"If you are like me and love to use your Apple Pencil the idea of having electronic journal you can hand write in  is exciting. Although day one journal has a feature that will allow you to use your pencil, it is extremely glitched. There are plenty of applications that allow this feature .For instance, Notes that comes with your iPhone allows you to integrate text with drawing or handwriting like you’re writing on paper. Another app that does that even better is Notability. 

I have been using Day One for my journaling for the last two years. Unfortunately I have had to transition to using Notability for my journaling.I’m only taking my time to write this because it is such an obvious feature a journal app should integrate into the software I am kind of taken back by the fact that they have not yet jumped on the Apple Pencil bandwagon. 

For the record, I am aware that you can use Apple Pencil on Day One application. But the feature is so flawed it’s almost irritating that it’s even an option.",rawmoxologist,2020-07-17T10:43:32-07:00,0,0,4.15.3,,1595007812

It reminds me of all the good in life, and all that has been overcome.

UPDATE:  I take it back.  I misunderstood the recording icon.  There is a difference between dictating an entry and creating a recording.  The developer contacted me to make sure I understood that point.
This app is invaluable to me for one purpose:  When I get sick, and have to take several medications on different schedules, I can simply dictate into my Apple Watch what time I take each med.  Right now I have a bad cold and am so sick I can’t keep track of anything.  This journal is exactly what I need.
I have other journals, too.  This is a great app.

My phone gets clogged up with photos I take throughout the day and finally I have a way to store the pictures, record a memory, AND PRINT the journal! I also LOVE the tag feature.

I loved the feature of putting a passcode on this so others cant access it or snoop. I typed one entry today and wanted to start a new entry about an hour later - different subject so i didnt want to put it all under one entry - and it keeps crashing!

Anytime i click the +(new entry) it will automatically close the screen. If i try clicking the other features such as the camera or microphone to see if those work, they do, however when i click “dont allow” (I’m not ready to add things like that to my entries just yet) it will immediately close the app.

This is so frustrating because it seems like it has so much potential. I’m not sure why this is happening. I had just restarted my device before downloading this, so i know that’s not the issue. I also cleared out apps running in the background so i know that isn’t an issue either. 

All i can do is log on..... and look at the main screen. This is so disappointing. With just downloading it today, there aren’t any updates so i know this isn’t the issue either. :(",omfgWhyAreAllNicknamesTaken?!,2020-05-18T08:57:13-07:00,0,0,4.13,,1589817433

First I started using Google Docs for my journal, but my mom was able to get into it and read everything I wrote, which was a big issue. So I downloaded a few other journaling apps but they didn’t have the features I wanted like the ability to add photos or a passcode (At the time I only had iOS 10 so I couldn’t download Day one)

When I got a new phone however, I was able to download day one and I was thrilled!! I was able to easily convert all of my entries from google docs to day one, and I’ve been using it ever since! I love the layout, photos, passcode, etc etc.

The only issue I have with it is how there’s no undo button. I spent 30 minutes writing out my dream, but then accidentally pasted a link on top of it while the whole thing was selected. I tried the “shake to undo” on iphones but it only deleted the link and my entry was gone. So an undo button would be a huge help!

Despite this minor issue, I love this app and suggest it to anybody who’s looking for a digital journal!",Jellyfuuush,2020-05-14T08:17:59-07:00,0,0,4.13,,1589469479

I was so excited to finally move away from handwriting my journals, but still have a physical copy. For a year I’ve recorded about the birth of my second son and all our family’s adventures! I love it!
But now that It’s time to print I’ve wasted a whole day (seriously, so many hours carrying my phone around and retrying to upload and enter the payment information) trying to order the book to no avail. I was given a few suggestions by the support team, but none of those worked either and I’m so sad! This was the whole reason I downloaded the app and now I feel like I won’t have a physical copy of all the things I journaled this year. I hope they sort something out ASAP for the book printing so I can come back one day and print all my memories.

So for that, I have to take a star away, and let the book printers out there know that it may not be the app for you if a physical copy is your goal. But if you’re happy with the digital copy, then this app would be amazing!",kasecam,2020-05-12T18:55:14-07:00,4,4,4.13,,1589334914
iOS App Store,5936928935,5,PDF format has improved- Thank you!,"THANK YOU for continuing to improve the PDF format! Just as I was about to give up and look for a journaling method elsewhere, the PDF format was improved and now there are multiple pictures per page, and the flow and format is a lot nicer. I also like that the text is larger and one page can even fit up to 9 pictures.  It still isn’t perfect. If I could give the suggestion to make the date and time font darker and maybe a little bigger, it would be near to perfect. That is hardly visible, especially once printed out. But the picture flow has dramatically improved, and I applaud you! I am fine paying a subscription as long as these updates are being made, because I appreciate the continuous work to improve the customer’s experience. So far, to the best of my knowledge, these improvements haven’t been made to the book printing, but I assume they are working on that as well. Thank you and please, for your subscribers, continue with these improvements! It’s the only thing that keeps me hanging on to this app because a physical, printed copy is so important to me, and though I love everything else about the app digitally, I would be forced to look elsewhere if I wasn’t satisfied with the printing (via book or PDF).

iOS App Store,5924369048,5,Excellent App with some bugs,I am using Dayone for years and I generally love it. One of my favorite features always was the Activity Feed which allows you to go back and write entries based on the location you were. A few years ago when the app was linked to Swarm this worked very well. Since then the locations are sometimes random and for a few weeks now it doesn’t work at all. It tells me I was at the “Florida Straits” all day every day. It is not the phone because the logging in the Google map timeline works excellent. When it used to work it displayed addresses instead of locations and they were usually off by a few streets.

iOS App Store,5894269078,5,Life changing,"TL;DR If you were once a person who used to journal, stopped, and now want to again but can’t seem to get into it... GET THIS APP!

I see a lot of reviews that often go something to the tune of, “I NEVER write reviews, but this app was so life changing I just HAD to!” I never understood how an app could inspire something like that in someone. I have, literally, never written a review on the App Store. However, after having Day One for a few years, I understand why people write these things. This app has, sincerely, impacted my life in a huge way that I could have never predicted. 

I originally was looking for some sort of journal app I could use in lieu of a physical journal, since I found that a big part of what held me back from journaling was that I didn’t really have the opportunity or drive to actually write something in a physical notebook as much, and I never seemed to have it on me when I felt like I had something to write. 

After some research I settled on Day One. After only a few short weeks of using it, I purchased a subscription and haven’t looked back since. Everything about how the app works- how the features function, the ease of use, the level of customization, the fact that you can have separate journals, and add almost any type of media... It keeps me writing. It keeps me thinking. It keeps me journaling. And that is something I had been seeking for years.

From the bottom of my heart, thank you Day One.",fangszup!,2020-05-02T11:49:40-07:00,0,0,4.12,,1588445380
iOS App Store,5868595350,5,"PERFECT, EXCEPT ONE MAJOR ISSUE...","My favorite journaling app. I was never able to commit to journaling— I’ve tried keeping physical journals, I’ve tried other apps, but this app was the only one that was able to keep me committed to writing. It offers so many useful tools and options, like templates, the ability to add photos, etc. (I do have the paid version btw.)

There is one problem I have with this app though, and that’s privacy. The app does allow you to have a passcode, but I’ve found that if you go to your device’s home screen and use the spotlight search to search on your device, you can actually use keywords to search for your entries and read them from there (therefore bypassing app’s passcode). For example, if you wrote an entry about apples, you could search “apples” on your device and the entry will show up there, where you can read the title of the entry, as well as a good portion of that entry’s content. This has actually gotten me into a good bit of trouble at home because someone else was able to search for keywords on my device and read my private entries from my device’s home screen. 

I really, truly hope this is fixed. I love this app and would hate to have to stop using it for this reason.",bbyblanco46,2020-04-26T17:48:53-07:00,7,12,4.12,,1587948533

iOS App Store,5857061732,3,Meh,"I tried premium for a year and felt it was decidedly “meh.” Definitely not worth the subscription fee.  

Sync was generally good, but I lost several long entries with lots of photos when editing at a time when wifi/LTE cut out.  The developers need to find a better way of handling sync conflicts.  

I also was not thrilled with the limited style and appearance customization options.  In particular, the quite small appearance of the date and its location on the screen was annoying when trying to read back through entries while maintaining a sense of what day the entry referred to.  Reading back through entries within the app was also clunky.  Finally, I wanted better options for image quality when exporting to PDF.  Even with just several photos per *week* (let alone per day), a PDF of one year’s worth of entries can easily be several gigabytes large.",antonbanton,2020-04-24T04:39:04-07:00,1,1,4.12,,1587728344

The only thing preventing me from giving 5 stars is that I wish it had web-browser accessibility. While I have an iPad and iPhone, I have a windows computer.

iOS App Store,5425697515,5,Amazing Concept But Seemingly Not Polishes,"Using the app for the first time on an IPhone XS running iOS 13.3. I’ve heard great things, and wanted to switch from a handwritten journal, so decided to try out the basic version. 

Was writing my first note when I felt an extremely noticeable flicker (input box moving up and down slightly) when typing each letter, in both light and dark modes. Happens when the input box just gets large enough to have a scrollbar. 

As I write this app review in the App Store, I don’t notice the same type of flickering, so I don’t think it’s an Apple bug. 

It wouldn’t be that bad, except the premise of the app is mostly to type into a box, so giving it two stars for now until this is fixed. I don’t think I can use this app to journal if the flickering persists. 

Also, I made some text bold (with the panel), and could not for the life of me change to not bold for following text. This stands in contrast to another note taking app like Bear, where switching markup is a breeze. I do appreciate the support for Markdown but wish there was a Bear like setting for continuing to show the markdown symbols even when automatically converting.

I get the idea that the device itself requires some form of authentication (passcode / fingerprint) in order to unlock, but I’d like the app to require (optionally) an additional level of authentication, like password management apps do. Unless, I missed something, that critical feature is missing from this otherwise great app.

UPDATE: the company pointed out that there is an option for setting a 4-digit passcode or a biometric form of authentication and that’s great! I just didn’t notice it. Still, it’s not possibile to have a classic free form password like I’d prefer, but it’s still a great app. Thanks for the help.",vlad88,2020-01-16T17:10:32-07:00,1,1,4.5,,1579219832

But I can’t give it five stars, because it, like many other apps out there, charges a subscription without a monthly benefit. I would gladly pay a one time purchase cost of even $100 for this app, because as I said, it’s excellent. But to be charged monthly or yearly simply so they can host it on their servers and provide the occasional update, seems a bit ridiculous. But companies continue to do it because not enough customers complain. So complain with me, guys! I’d happily host it myself or choose my cloud storage preference, especially for something like my own journal, which I’d prefer not to have in a small company’s hands anyway. 

Having said all that, if you don’t mind being overcharged and having less control about where your journal is, the app itself is near perfect. I can’t think of any faults. It’s phenomenal.",lauraberry7,2020-01-13T22:21:37-07:00,2,2,4.4.1,,1578979297
iOS App Store,5378717965,5,Best way to journal over the long run.,"I have gone back and forth between electronic and physical journals over the years but have finally permanently committed to the electronic journal using Day One. 

A favorite feature is being able to print a nice physical copy of my journal. I do this every year so I have a hard copy. 

Now that I’ve got entries spanning six plus years, a feature that I absolutely love is the “on this day” feature. If there are past entries on the same day of the year from years past it notifies me of them and I can quickly read what I wrote years ago. It’s a cool and easy way to see what I wrote in the past. I’ve always wanted to be better about going back and reading my past journals but it’s hard to get around to.

Tags: You still cannot search entries by multiple tags with AND. If I wanted to view entries that only had a combination of two or more tags, I cannot. Day One lists ALL entries with any of the selected tags. I consider this a basic function of a tagging system, but Day One considers this function unnecessary. Right now the tags function is rudimentary at best. 

Screen use on iPad: Want to see what Day One is like on a gorgeous iPad screen? You'll be disappointed! The world's top tablet gets the short end of the stick yet again! On the iPhone you can view photo thumbnails, maps, and calendars on full screen. I was excited to scroll around through photos or locations on a nice big iPad screen. Too bad Day One offers only a little strip on the left side of the screen with no option to expand to full screen. This seems especially ridiculous and clumsy when using the map.

I don’t understand why the designers and developers have to do updates that make a perfect thing go bust. This last update has driven me crazy. It seems like everything has been changed. I love to work on an entry and then see what happened on that day in the past. I used to have one click to bring up all the entries from multiple journals in a simple scrolling list that I could review. Not so now. In order to find a list of all the entries it takes about 3 or 4 clicks and searches and then the entries come up in backwards order from what it was so that the newest is at the bottom. 
Navigating in Day one one used to be simple and easy and now with this latest update it just feels so disjointed. If this was my first experience with Day One I would say no thank you. Since a huge chunk of my life is put down in it’s pages, I will have to get used to a whole new way of getting around.

I also can apply tags to each post, so it’s super easy to find old diary post in the archives by just looking through the tags. Plus there’s the awesome steps counter, location mark, format and font options, dark mode, social media link, and more.

However, particularly with journals, writers value their privacy and are trusting perhaps some of their innermost thoughts, feelings and experiences to a third party, given little or no information about its security as is the case with Day One.

Apple's iCloud, on the other hand, has a proven track record. So many people value their photos above all else because they often can’t be replaced and iCloud delivers a wonderful service there and in the case of similar backups. Should you have any problems, you can pick up the phone and call Apple Care– they have stellar ""geniuses"" eager to help.

The subscription model is way off base. I understand there is maintenance, research and development costs incurred– of course. But the customers will walk away owning absolutely nothing.

Although I already paid for Day One, I would have been happy to pay for an update but there is only so much Day One is worth. Day One does at least think enough of their customers not to trample all over them as I’ve seen dozens of subscription hungry app companies do. For that I’m sure a lot of writers are grateful.",IrishPirQueen,2019-07-03T03:00:41-07:00,2,2,3.8,,1562148041
iOS App Store,4403179302,5,Amazing features,"I took a job as a lineman about two years ago. Started looking for an app where I could log a work journal of sorts. Everyday I’m working in a new place, surrounded by beautiful mountains. I found Day One and made it a mission to take at least one pic everyday (with location on). I can pull up a map in the journal and see every place I took a picture. If I need to remember if we did a job on a certain road, I pull up the app and search. I have the exact day, time, pictures and even the weather. 
I highly recommend purchasing premium. It’s not much money and you get great features. Really hope Day One will be around for decades to come. I would love to look back at the journal 10-20 years from now!",Racerx102,2019-07-02T18:41:04-07:00,0,1,3.8,,1562118064

It is TOTALLY WORTH the $35 annual fee.   You’d have to purchase a new journal every year anyway.  AND it’s LOCKED - you have to sign in to access it, good of you are afraid of snoopers!

Entries are organized in a list with their photons displayed on the left side so they are very easy to view and review.   I have used it for 3 years and enjoyed it. I have never paid for premium because I don’t need or want multiple journals or photos per entry. For free I can add a photo to each entry and write as many entries as I want.

iOS App Store,4303145299,2,Avoid. Use plain text files instead.,"I used to keep my IRL and dream journals in plain text files named by date stored securely on my own computer. In 2014 I gave Day One Classic (the free version) a try. I created 360 entries and synced them to iCloud—which the EFF now reports uses fake encryption. Whether it has occurred or not this app has led many to possible data collection under the unconstitutional PRISM program made possible by the Bush administration in the United States following 9/11.

I will never again be so foolish as to not use text files to keep my intimate thoughts private and away from prying eyes such as those of post-Jobs Apple, the US government or a capitalist institution interested in coercing me into their revenue stream by attempting to sell me privacy with potentially buggy E2E encryption.

Bottom line, I wouldn’t use this software even if I was paid to do so.",jhabdas,2019-06-11T23:54:04-07:00,1,1,3.7,,1560322444

I thought I was being careful, not mentioning names, employer, etc but I wasn’t and I wanted a safe way to record my thoughts and feelings and keep it from prying eyes. 

I started using this app. I’m glad I found it. 

When they went to premium I was set back at first for the yearly fee but with end-to-end encryption of my data I went ahead and took the plunge. 

I cannot day enough about the support I get from Cameron and the others whenever I run into a snag, which is not that often. Maybe three times in all the times I use the app.   If it’s late in the evening I get the closed message and I am content waiting for their response but it’s usually not long at all. Most of the time they have responded to my query within 10 minutes of my submitting the issue. 

Every time they have responded, their suggestions have worked to correct my problem, which most of the time was a sync issue.

Lately I have noticed serious performance issues though. Latest iPhone (or maybe last gen I forget tbh) and when I go to edit or make a new article it lags like crazy. I’m fairly proficient typing with the default keyboard and I can type out 2 sentences, but need to sit back and watch it for 15-20 seconds for the cursor to catch up. I also make many spelling mistakes so this makes going back to fix them unbearable.. but really the lag throws me off so it’s kind of unusable in general at this point.

I would give the ap a 5, but I have been trying for six months to order something like $400 worth of printed journals, and after six months of the developers trying to troubleshoot, only one journal has been able to be printed.

Taken 2 stars off simply because the devs tend not to include information in what they take out so a user will know if to up date or wait for the next version. Disabling things that a user is use to using on a daily basis is no cool, I use templates on a daily basis, they are fast and I don't need to retype things all over again and they also remind me as well at a certain time frame, very inconvenient for them to just turn it off it's not broken so why do that? Also the way to add locations has changed its more difficult to get a good on where you are if it's not saved this use to work flawless in early versions before iOS 12 they never seem to bring it back.

I love being able to look at the entries from the prior years each morning and even if it’s just a photo it takes me back to what was going on that day.

I keep my journal totally private because it is just for me. I can vent as much as I want and no one will see it but me. I can record my weight. I even keep one entry called “questions for the doctor“ and each time I think of one more thing that I want to ask I search that and add it. That way when I go into the doctor I remember everything I need to ask.

iOS App Store,4241295009,4,Extreme Risk of Tragic Data Loss,"I have been faithfully keeping Day One Journal entries for years. One of the in-app purchase offers they have for sale is to collect your entries into nice hard-copy bound books— which seems a good backup in the event of Zombie apocalypse or whatever. Thinking of purchasing my entire life history in a series of hard copies, I went to search through my life entries, and could find NO ENTRY PRIOR TO 2017!

A protracted convo with customer support yielded nothing but repeated directions to a FAQ article that had outdated, false information. So far, after days of striving, I have hit a brick wall. Apparently, all my older entries survive in iCloud, but they are irretrievable unless I can redownload the oldest version of the app, now called Day One Classic— but no such thing seems to be available via customer support’s instructions. 

Customer Support explained this is all due to them “changing their business model”, but their change in business model has cost me years of life history, uncountable hours of journal writing and numerous hours trying to recover my old data without success.

It’s so popular that the amount of new users vastly outnumbers the amount of long-time users. I still use it, but I don’t always have my phone with me.

I recently found this app and I’m soooo glad I did. It is exactly what I was looking for! 

I had my grandkids over the other day and I was able to put their pictures in this journal as I was writing about them... can’t do that in a paper journal.

I love that I can export a PDF (I use as a backup!), although the photo layouts end up awkward.  I’ve never tried printing one of the books.

And I love that, like Facebook (which I’m trying to use less), it will show me all my entries from a specific day of the year, across the years.  This means that every year, I get to relive those funny things my kids said, or the weird situation that happened on the metro, or the amazing sporting event we saw.  My memory is like a sieve, and this makes me feel more connected.

I have a bunch of journals in the app, including a family book that I intend to eventually publish yearly for memories with the kids, and a personal journal, and a reading journal.

Lately I’ve added a new journal for all the miscellaneous memorabilia I want to have a memory of, but for which I no longer need the physical items around my house.  I just use the date I let the item go as my date for the entry, with a note about the object in question.

There are two reasons I didn’t give 5 stars: 

1. Case sensitive hashtags — If one instance of a hashtag is capitalized and other instances are lower case, the capitalized instance will not show up when I search the lowercase tag. I don’t see a reason why #Dream and #dream should be two separate lists. Whenever I enter a hashtag on the fly, I have to remember whether the original instance was capitalized or lower case.  Obviously I should just create all tags lowercase, right? Tell that to my autocorrect. If the hashtag is at the beginning of a sentence, autocorrect will capitalize it. If I’m dropping a tag somewhere in the middle of a sentence, it will naturally not be capitalized. 

2. Advertisements — The idea of providing a book printing service for the journal add-on is great, but I feel like I pay enough for this app to avoid advertisements.

Until now I had not found anything close to the versatility of using pen and paper.  I have used Day One every day for the last 35 or so days and found it amazing.  Sometimes I use my iPad and sometimes I use my iPhone but it always works well and syncs up quick.  I have even used the Apple Watch to enter a quick entry (great while traveling).  

I will also Day One’s support is beyond amazing.  Three times I have asked for assistance and all 3 times I received it in a matter of minutes (maybe seconds).  In my case Adam was the support person and he was prompt and very helpful.  Yes, I do miss a few things about using pen and paper, like having a one page monthly summary where I could note highlights or maybe a place to record meetings by the hour, but life is about compromises and Day One’s pluses far out weigh anything I gave up.

The app has the ability to have multiple journals that you can name whatever you want. This gives the ability to segregate different thoughts for much better organization.

iOS App Store,3307665258,3,I want to like DayOne but . . .,"The issue for me is that it doesn't sync with iCloud, a cloud service I already subscribe to. Yes, it's true that iCloud has had issues in the past but it's very robust now. It's also encrypted in transit and at rest. 

The subscription model is an issue with me too. Especially since the three day outage and loss of data around the time I signed up. Also, the sync between the Mac and iPad was always running into non-connect issues. I worked with the developer on this, sent many dumps, but nothing was resolved. When I discussed the issues I was having with my devices not syncing (iPad, iPhone, MacBook) I discovered that the developer didn't have five 9s (high availability) and this was scary to me. 

Also, the files are not stored individually but rather in a location I can't access. This ties me to an export function should I decide to move journaling apps. 

Although I'd been with DayOne since the beginning and upgraded to DayOne's subscription service, I decided to cut my losses and move to iA Writer which supports sync with iCloud (and it's encryption) and write individual files in markdown (no special format) thereby future-proofing my 20 years of journals. I can at any time view my journals/journal entries and open them with any markdown or text editor. Apple's new ""Shortcuts"" (workflows) makes adding a new entry or updating an existing one a breeze.  For me this is the best journaling solution.

I used to do short text notes in iOS’ Notes App to complement my pictures, and I’ll admit, I still do on occasion, but I’m doing more and more in Day One, mostly because it’s easier to associate with a picture. I also love the location recording for notes, used to be I’d take pictures of just whatever wall or floor my phone was facing simply to record a location to accompany a text note in Notes, now, don’t have to. I still don’t write a whole lot, but the convenience of logging things, like weather and location has encouraged me to use Day One more. I highly recommend trying it for anyone who’s meticulous like I am about recording all the little details. Only thing I would improve is having the ability to save location data forever, currently location data is only saved for six weeks unless you manually save an entry for a place.

iOS App Store,3301502226,1,Can No Longer Edit Markdown,"I have been a longtime user of Day One (many years). One of my main uses has been to write my own Markdown or store my favorite web clippings in Markdown.

Access to text-only Markdown editing is gone. Now I cannot edit and create new links within text. It is now a pop-up system to edit links. Headings can no longer be edited as the pop up menu doesn’t show what the heading was in the first place.

It saddens me when great software gets dumbed down for the masses and removes core features after years of working well. As capitalism unfortunately has a greed forcing function, the masses are served and everything eventually drops to the lowest common denominator, and not necessarily the simplest UI.

If Day One would allow a setting to go back to real text editing, I would stick with it. Now it is becoming a narrower app that is only used for a single purpose.

It may soon have auto-filling checklists with background meditative music and deviate to pushing mono-emotional states of happiness rather than allowing a sad or angry entry.

On the only positive note, they left their export options, which I will now explore to their fullest extent.

There are some decent programs out there, but they are unrefined in my opinion.

I have yet one more place I need to look for data from and I seemingly never have true control over my personal data!  They did grandfather my stuff in with a Plus subscription which is ok.  However, since I no longer have control over my own data, I will probably just start using One Note and keep the data locally on my own MyCloud server at home.  I do like the app and would stay with it if they would do the following:
 1. Add back the ability to store on the popular cloud services.
2. Have an option for self storage in a file anywhere.
3. Create an upgrade model where you need to upgrade and pay for the app if you want new major features once every so often.
4. Keep the subscription model for those who want cross platform syncing, but also allow cross platform reading of the same data file in 2.

I love everything about this app, except one thing: every time I’m typing I accidentally hit one of the many tiny buttons right above the keyboard. I love that all of those buttons are available, but they are way too close to the letters for a journal app where typing is such a huge component.

Even the formatting setup that has replaced the old markdown-style toolbar requires an extra tap, and I make more mistakes than I did whenever I used the old markdown-style toolbar. 

This is primarily a problem specifically with iPhone keyboard and does not make a huge difference with my iPad Pro since all the markdown syntax can be accessed on the keyboard itself.

I could have used Apple Notes or a number of other Alps, but I really like the elegance of Day One and how I can customize it. I also like the On This Day reminders.

People have been using word processing apps like Microsoft Word for years and years that give the ability to mark up without the code-like conventions of the asterisk method.

Of course, I do understand that Day One has to make money somehow, and that there must be incentive for people to buy the premium version; also, the absence of said capabilities isn’t incredibly debilitating either.

I have a suggestion for the people at “Day One” come up with an app to help people write their lives history! I’m sure that there are many more people like me that if they had a app something that would encourage and formatting it! I really bet it would be a Home Run for them!

iOS App Store,2691104844,4,Great app since the beginning,"I’ve been using digital journals since 2009 and have had to move between numerous products because of companies shutting down, and Day One v1 was the first paid product I used to store entries. After hesitation to the subscription model, I gave in and upgraded to v2, and I still love the software. I journal every day, so Day One gets more use than almost any other app.....a more justifiable expense, so that this app always works with new iOS versions and features.

My only request is a feature of an older journal app, which had a fun nightly Reflection email with entries from a random day in the past. With Day One, it’s not quite as fun or prominent to reflect on old entries just for nostalgia sake.",Hank Brekke,2018-06-13T22:19:41-07:00,0,0,2.7,,1528953581

However, there is one modification I’d recommend to the the app developers that would make it better. That would be to have the ability to add videos to the journals.

iOS App Store,2648080505,5,Love this app,"I seriously love this app and have totally migrated over all my history stuff into it to have (hopefully) forever. I keep track of everything I do and this works perfect for me. It even integrates with the app Workflow! The app itself functions flawlessly for me and I intend to continue using it so as long as it exists! It's got some excellent features you'll love and that streamline things for you.

My gripes, although small, would improve this app even more:
The only thing I wish is that it used end-to-end encryption as everyone else has said. I don't keep anything secure in it but just that peace of mind would be nice.
I also notice the On This Day widget acts weird... it shows stuff that wasn't really ""on this day"" at a glance.

Other than that - it's great especially when paired with the Mac version.

EDIT: Can we get a minor tweak to the book printing feature? The ability to filter and print only posts with specific tags? I know I can create another journal just for that tag but I like having one big journal for everything and having tags within.

It seems clear that the creators of this app I have put a lot of work into holding it based on user feedback as it has some really great features that I haven't seen implemented this well in a journaling app. I haven't noticed any glitches so far and it seems to save my journal entries periodically so if I have to exit out in the middle of an entry I don't lose what I've already typed in. I'm only a weekend to using it, but I hope to use it more and more for things like preparing for my day, preparing blog posts about my travels and other adventures, personal journaling, end of day review, and dream journaling.

It took me about 30 minutes and after I was done I was searching for a way to indent the paragraphs, so I selected the entire entry and was surveying the options when I accidentally pasted a link I had copied. Everything was deleted because I pasted the link when the entire entry was selected. Here is why I’m giving two stars: there is not an undo button or back button. I feel as though it is imperative and, quite frankly, obvious that a journaling app, centered around writing and composition would have a feature that allows you to undo the most recent change to an entry. I haven’t journaled in months and this easily avoidable accident does not make me very optimistic about trying it again any time soon, especially with Day One if there is a chance this could happen again. I would happily continue using the app if an undo feature was added, but for now I am too shaken up from those memories being deleted and having no way of getting them back to use Day One again without doubting that this will happen to any of my future entries.",bridgetbates17,2018-03-24T10:54:12-07:00,20,35,2.5.12,,1521914052

I have never seen journal entries done backwards. You can’t change the design. You have to look very closely for the date, as they are in tiny print, and the only large part of the date is the day - 05. 05 of what? Just made an entry on March 2, it doesnt show up at the top, I made another one. Then found both amidst the entries made in February, before February 3d, because there was no entry made on 02 February, the designers desided let’s stick 02 March entry in there. I want to clearly see the full date the entry was made on or have an option to change the design - if someone wants to only see the day of the month, let them have it, but I want to see the month and the year, and have it run chronologically forward. For some reason the designers think that the time and place where it’s made is more important. Hello most entries by most peope are made at home, the same location every time. 
Why half the screen is taken by a plus sign and a camera? Why one of the lines tells me how many entries I made and pictures taken? Does it matter to anyone who keeps a journal?  Also has glitches with fonts and formatting.",Buyerdisg,2018-03-02T09:06:29-07:00,9,18,2.5.12,,1520006789

I’ll use an example of an issue: I begin an entry on my iPhone but then I go to finish it on my Mac. Should be no problem with cloud storage. 
What’s happening is the app will often re-recognize uploads from other devices as your working on editing an entry and will completely overwrite your work with the previous upload. So in my example, if I’m picking it back up on my Mac. After 10 mins of typing my uploads will resync and it wipe all my work I was doing. And this is a very frustrating issue. The only way I’ve prevented this is by closing all other instances of Day One when working on another device. But this could be fixed by having user prompts for conflicting iCloud uploads for similar entries. I have seen other apps simply have a message pop up saying they detected multiple instances of the same thing and asking for me to choose which one to continue working on or delete. Why is it so hard to utilize that kind of feature? Anyways that’s a big issue for me.

Unlike many users, I can live with a subscription model, BUT for that extra cost, I want a product that is nearly bug free, speedy, and doesn't require using another app to accomplish a basic function that the competition implemented many versions ago.

iOS App Store,2250217852,5,A request to address certain problems,"I’ve been using your app for years, definitely one of the best apps I have ever used. However lately I have been facing problems. I have an iPhone 8. Often times when I copy or past something, the app would lag a lot and then crash and I would need to restart it. Another huge problem I have is that when I want to edit an entry, the app would instantly take me to the bottom of the entry instead of the place I already was. I write long entries so if I’m in the middle of something and notice a typo, I don’t want to fix it because it will take me all the way to the bottom. And if I slide up and tap on the text I want to edit, most of the time the app just keeps taking me back to the bottom. I think I have to double tap it sometimes and make sure I am not sliding to get it to select the text I want. It is so frustrating for me, why can this not work like google docs where it just stays at the same spot I click edit instead of going all the way down. Please, I have been a loyal customer for a very long time and I hope you fix this, or either give me an option to disable this ‘function’.

They changed their business model, and now you must pay lots of money for a subscription.

At least, until recently. They used to have an issue with entries disappearing. The problem mostly went away until the last few months, when it started happening again. I’ll write 500-1,000 words and then as soon as I click “done” the entry reverts back to only the first few sentences. I would understand if this was a rare bug, but it happens on average in about 1 in 10 entries. It’s gotten to the point where I have to back up each entry separately to avoid losing data, which defeats the purpose of using the app.

Is spoke to customer service and they literally just told me that they know this happens and they’re working on it. I find it difficult to believe that it takes a YEAR to work out a basic function of the app, especially now that we’re paying the developers annually to work on this kind of thing. I have no problem paying you guys on subscription as long as you’re bringing value to the table, but when you’re spending hours on adding fancy colors while ignoring basic UX, it really has me questioning whether my money would be best spent elsewhere.

But every word of my review from when they first introduced the subscription model still applies: no audio recording, no publishing, no web version, and typing still is a frustrating experience compared to typing in other apps. This slow development is increasingly frustrating.

My original review:

I love Day One and the ability to look back on entries by date and location. I'm happy to pay a subscription model, but hope that means they come through with new features soon, namely audio recording and publishing to a blog (now that they're working on a web version I hope they simply allow you to make a journal public/password protected so anyone can view it). Those are long wished for/promised features that would make my workflow even simpler. 

Finally, I still experience typing lag issues on both my iPhone and iPad pro. I type long entries, so generally use Drafts 4 and then import the text.

I recently decided to purchase the app for myself and noticed only after I wasted the money purchasing it, that new users must pay yearly to sync thru day one and there is no iCloud sync option like there was previosly. They literally went out of their way to redesign the app so they could make more money despite complaints from many consumers. 

I will find another solution. It’s a shame because this was a great app, that’s why I gave it two stars instead of one for the greedy developer. Most people pay Apple for extra iCloud storage, asking them to pay the developer for the same functionality is a disgrace. They can use whatever lame excuse they want, that it’s going to benefit for future software features.

Maybe just keeping a journal on my computer in word so I can format it the way I like.",Night reader mn,2017-12-29T06:06:30-07:00,0,1,2.5.9,,1514552790
iOS App Store,1988985166,5,Beware!,"I have been using this as a diary for a couple or three years. loved it. Now all my entires are only available on my iPhone 6+ and my new iPad no longer syncs life my older iPad did. I have to view and enter entries only on my smaller screened phone. This company has terrible support and is only interest in $ and upgrades to premium service, more $. I’m about ready to quit journaling due to the disappointment with this app and it’s extremely poor service. Save yourself the heartbreak.

Update:
Problems continue:
Now neither iPad or iPhone allow me to post pictures to my pages and I just get a white blank page when I try to click on support. Clearly they have no support!",Lwleetacwa,2017-12-11T13:52:29-07:00,2,3,2.5.8,,1513025549
iOS App Store,1986965874,5,Versatile tool with great company behind it,"This app has made it so much easier to consistently journal, and has given me the ability to capture photos and web links in addition to my written notes.

I use this app on my phone and iPad, but got really frustrated that I couldn’t use it on my laptop because I didn’t have a Mac. When I wrote as much to the Day One team, I got a response within hours (on a Sunday night) that pointed me to a Chrome extension and page (beta) that allow me to access and post in my DO journal from my laptop. 

Totally worth the subscription price.",Bearborne,2017-12-10T18:34:52-07:00,1,1,2.5.8,,1512956092
iOS App Store,1953000329,5,The only journaling app needed,"I had been searching endlessly for a journaling app that would be easy to use, fun to use and have all the robust features to document our family’s journey through life. This app nails it! I’ve used this app for almost 3 years and the first journal documented my my wife and I’s crazy long road to being blessed with twin boys through 2 rounds of IVF. These little dudes turn 2 in less than 2 weeks and without this app, we wouldn’t be able to look back on all the great, and not great moments that we’ve experienced over the years. If you’re like me and research and search until your head spins, stop looking and download Day One. You won’t regret it.",DaddyToddles,2017-11-27T08:37:48-07:00,3,3,2.5.8,,1511797068
iOS App Store,1947993068,5,Revised rating for new version,"I contacted the developer about losing text and learned that I was not using the latest version.  Because of a name change, I did not realize to upgrade.  This version works very well, does what I want and gives me the freedom and flexibility I need.

More important, I was very impressed by the developer’s willingness to understand my problem and work to figure out how to solve it.  This is a great company to do business with, I am very impressed by them and their willingness to accommodate their users.  An excellent software product and an excellent company.",MEB1938,2017-11-25T07:17:50-07:00,1,1,2.5.8,,1511619470

It has made it so easy to keep a record of our fun and special moments, milestones, etc. This app has been a lifesaver. It is functional with helpful features and an elegant interface. Love the option to print journals, as well. Haven’t done that yet, but looking forward to trying it. 

Then, somehow I recently lost all of my journals! But the support team went above and beyond to help me restore them. Very grateful for their help and glad to be able to journal with confidence again!",MrMG2,2017-11-18T09:46:13-07:00,0,1,2.5.8,,1511023573
iOS App Store,1924993897,4,Angry about new subscription requirement,"When 2.0 rolled out we were told we could continue using the older ‘classic ‘ version we previously paid for. Now I have a new phone and I can’t use the app unless I want to fork out $35 a year. I know the cost is about 67 cents a day but it angers me when I paid to have something (with syncing between devices), used it for 3 years, thousands of journal entries later, and then it’s taken away. I will now have to waste time finding out how to import my entries into another program because the whole idea was to have all my entries accessible and in one place. Or maybe I need to give up on technology and go back to paper and pen, bc this is not the first time an app developer has moved to this model and took away the functionality of the app I liked.",tarabe11e,2017-11-16T04:21:56-07:00,2,2,2.5.8,,1510831316
iOS App Store,1908131603,5,Normally lovely,"I love this app and plan on printing a few books in the future. Recently on my iPhone X I noticed that if I type beyond where the keyboard sits, the page doesn’t automatically shift down to continue to show me what I’m typing but jumps back to the top of the screen. When I scroll back down it doesn’t show any of what I just typed. It’s frustrating. When I click done it will show my full entry but if I try to edit it, I cannot move very far down the page. I only noticed this after the most recent update. 
I’ll update my review if this is fixed. 
Thanks for making a great app

Update: I changed my review from 3 to 5 stars. The update that was pushed out recently fixed my problem. Thanks so much!",CalyanJaele,2017-11-09T02:11:12-07:00,2,2,2.5.8,,1510218672
iOS App Store,1905222125,2,Been using for years,"I would give it 5 stars but for some reason for months now when i type - it lags sooooo much it pisses me off no other app lags on my phone so i have to blame day one. Its beyond frustrating. 

I also hate that when i open the app, my last entry opens. I don't need my last entry. 99% i need to write a new one and i have to close that one then open a diff journal then click new. That's just so annoying to me. I wish it would just go to the home screen every time.

I also just found out they changed it to an annual subscription. I feel very betrayed because I bought this about 4 years ago and paid full price to have it on all devices. Then they released a new version and increases the price by like 500%. Then on top of that they changed it to a subscription $50 a year. This just pure greed. I hate subscriptions and have like 2,000 journal entries. So of course i feel forced to now pay their stupid subscription. Ridiculous.",Dejaliyah,2017-11-07T20:21:04-07:00,8,10,2.4.2,,1510111264
iOS App Store,1887546608,5,Journalist,"For me I have been journaling for 9 years with composition books. (Pen and paper) For a year I have transitioned to using Day One as my go to place to Journal and going paperless. There are many ways to expand the horizons of journaling. Day One offers features to expand those horizons. Although there are so many features I have found my use of Day One to be very simple, to write down my daily activity, and in a chronological fashion. There is simplicity here for just writing.

I find journaling much more rich and fascinating today. I like to try new systems like the bullet Journal with traditional composition books. In Day One I have multiple journals. I use IFTTT to send my social media into Day One. Day One has opened my world up to new possibilities. I love this app. I have used many other writing apps and find them useful. Day One remains my place for journaling.",Joadal_,2017-10-31T05:13:57-07:00,9,13,2.5.5,,1509452037
iOS App Store,1884462591,4,Best and most functional journal app!,"I rarely review apps, seeing as I find many to be barely mediocre. However, I am rather quite impressed with Day One. The interface is clean and feature-rich, allowing you to add images, location, and even weather, to your entries. The entries, and their content, are stored separately from your phone’s integrated apps, so if you lose your pictures from the Photos app, you don’t lose the images placed in your entries. Off-phone backup and syncing, combined with encryption, even optional, private end-to-end encryption, makes retention and security top notch! I’d hate to lose what I’ve journaled, but with the IAP subscription (again, something I exceedingly rarely am open to paying), this app makes a place for itself on my home page.",Ebiss00,2017-10-29T19:21:49-07:00,2,3,2.5.5,,1509330109
iOS App Store,1840986444,5,I’d give it a 5 but...,"I loved this app — and then start having glitchy issues a couple weeks ago. Support is awesome but I haven’t heard back on why it keeps crashing every time I try to add more photos into an entry. Maybe it has an issue with larger photo streams (I had 250 pics)? Whatever the case I was disappointed I couldn’t chronicle a big trip we took and eventually had to move the photos off my phone because I was running out of room. Since this is an app without a desktop version (you can view but not edit) I couldn’t finish the journal. I’ll update this review if we’re able to resolve the issue, otherwise I’ll be looking for another journaling app to migrate to.",MommyApp,2017-10-11T00:29:39-07:00,3,4,2.5.3,,1507706979
iOS App Store,1819347617,5,"Developer, read this!","A few days ago, I downloaded the latest version. I want to clarify that I started using this app years ago and loved it ever since.

Upon downloading the newer version I was angry initially at having to pay a subscription in order to back up the information. But then, I analyzed how awesome this app is. I also read that the Mac app is included in the subscription, and once more, I realized this is the best app of its kind. I use this app in conjunction with Things and consider both the very best in terms of usability, reliability, interface, and efficiency.

I wish to thank you. Now, is there a way to add my previous entries from iCloud to mu current updated version? I deleted the original app.",Mango himself,2017-09-30T12:51:50-07:00,2,3,2.5.2,,1506801110

I tried numerous apps, but found Day One to be the simplest, loaded with useful features and liked that is synced to the cloud reliably so either device was always up to date. In the three years of usage, I have never had a single issue. Enhancements are great, and I don't think I use everyone of them yet.

This journal does just that. It's clean, simple and very functional. Plus it comes with a lot of features I'm interested to explore--metadata, tags, syncing etc. I paid for the premium yearly subscription to sync across my devices, which probably isn't worth it if you're not serious about journaling.
